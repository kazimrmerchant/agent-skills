## When to Use
Use this skill when implementing realistic 3D lighting, shadow optimization, global illumination, or light probes in Godot 4.x. 
Trigger keywords: `DirectionalLight3D`, `OmniLight3D`, `SpotLight3D`, `shadow_enabled`, `directional_shadow_mode`, `directional_shadow_split`, `omni_range`, `omni_attenuation`, `spot_range`, `spot_angle`, `VoxelGI`, `SDFGI`, `LightmapGI`, `ReflectionProbe`, `Environment`, `WorldEnvironment`.

## Prerequisites
- Godot 4.x (Forward+ renderer required for SDFGI and `AreaLight3D` features).
- Windows host (PowerShell) for local file operations if modifying scripts directly.

## Procedure

### 1. Load Required Scripts
**MANDATORY**: Read the appropriate script before implementing the corresponding pattern.
- `scripts/day_night_cycle.gd`: Dynamic sun position and color based on time-of-day. Load when building outdoor day/night systems.
- `scripts/light_probe_manager.gd`: VoxelGI and SDFGI management. Load when setting up global illumination.
- `scripts/lighting_manager.gd`: Dynamic light pooling and LOD. Load when optimizing performance with many lights.
- `scripts/volumetric_fx.gd`: Volumetric fog and god ray configuration. Load for atmospheric effects.
- `scripts/shadow_cascade_tuner.gd`: Adjusting DirectionalLight3D shadow split distances dynamically. Load for outdoor shadow optimization.
- `scripts/lightmap_bake_helper.gd`: Advanced LightmapGI configuration using Shadowmasking mode. Load for hybrid static/dynamic shadowing.
- `scripts/sdfgi_probe_manager.gd`: Dynamic quality scaler for real-time GI (SDFGI). Load when adjusting cell size and occlusion for performance/quality trade-offs.
- `scripts/volumetric_fog_zones.gd`: Smoothly transitioning localized fog density. Load for cave entrances or forest clearings using Tweens and Area3D triggers.
- `scripts/fake_gi_bounce.gd`: Efficient 'Mobile-GI' pattern. Load when simulating light bouncing off the floor for lower-end platforms.
- `scripts/environment_blender.gd`: Transitioning WorldEnvironment parameters. Load for gameplay-based Sky, Ambient, and Tonemap transitions.
- `scripts/shadow_bias_tuner.gd`: Correcting 'Peter Panning' and 'Shadow Acne'. Load for high-fidelity directional light optimization.
- `scripts/light_lod_optimizer.gd`: Distance-based shadow and visibility culling. Load for dense OmniLight3D environments.
- `scripts/reflection_probe_manager.gd`: Performance-aware ReflectionProbe handling. Load for large environmental changes using manual 'Update Once' triggers.
- `scripts/spotlight_projector_setup.gd`: High-detail lighting using Projector textures. Load to fake complex shadow patterns (grates, glass ripples).

### 2. DirectionalLight3D (Sun/Moon) & Shadow Cascades
For outdoor scenes, use parallel 4-split shadow cascades for better quality at distance.

```gdscript
extends DirectionalLight3D

func _ready() -> void:
    shadow_enabled = true
    directional_shadow_mode = SHADOW_PARALLEL_4_SPLITS
    
    # Split distances (in meters from camera)
    directional_shadow_split_1 = 10.0   # First cascade: 0-10m
    directional_shadow_split_2 = 50.0   # Second: 10-50m
    directional_shadow_split_3 = 200.0  # Third: 50-200m
    # Fourth cascade: 200m - max shadow distance
    
    directional_shadow_max_distance = 500.0
    directional_shadow_blend_splits = true  # Smooth transitions
```

### 3. OmniLight3D (Point Light) Attenuation
Keep `omni_range` as small as visually acceptable. Light attenuation is quadratic.

```gdscript
extends OmniLight3D

func _ready() -> void:
    omni_range = 10.0  # Maximum reach
    omni_attenuation = 2.0  # Falloff curve (1.0 = linear, 2.0 = quadratic/realistic)
    
    # For "magical" lights, reduce attenuation
    # omni_attenuation = 0.5  # Flatter falloff, reaches farther
```

### 4. SpotLight3D (Flashlight/Headlights) & Projectors
Use projector textures (cookies/gobos) to fake complex shadow patterns.

```gdscript
extends SpotLight3D

func _ready() -> void:
    spot_range = 20.0
    spot_angle = 45.0  # Cone angle (degrees)
    spot_angle_attenuation = 2.0  # Edge softness
    shadow_enabled = true
    
    # Projector texture (optional)
    light_projector = load("res://textures/flashlight_mask.png")
```

### 5. Global Illumination: VoxelGI vs SDFGI
- **VoxelGI**: Use for indoor, small-medium scenes. Place one per room/area and tightly fit the `size`.
- **SDFGI**: Use for large outdoor scenes. Enable via `WorldEnvironment`. Forward+ exclusive.

```gdscript
# VoxelGI Setup
extends VoxelGI

func _ready() -> void:
    size = Vector3(20, 10, 20) # Tightly fit the room
    subdiv = VoxelGI.SUBDIV_128
    bake()
```

```gdscript
# SDFGI Setup
extends WorldEnvironment

func _ready() -> void:
    var env := environment
    env.sdfgi_enabled = true
    env.sdfgi_use_occlusion = true
    env.sdfgi_read_sky_light = true
    env.sdfgi_min_cell_size = 0.2
    env.sdfgi_max_distance = 200.0
```

### 6. LightmapGI (Baked Static Lighting)
Use for static architecture (buildings, dungeons) or mobile/low-end targets. 
Bake in the editor (not runtime). Use Shadowmasking mode for hybrid static/dynamic shadowing.

```gdscript
extends LightmapGI

func _ready() -> void:
    quality = LightmapGI.BAKE_QUALITY_HIGH
    bounces = 3  # Indirect light bounces
```

### 7. Environment, Sky & Volumetric Fog
Configure HDR skybox and volumetric fog via `WorldEnvironment`.

```gdscript
extends WorldEnvironment

func _ready() -> void:
    var env := environment
    env.background_mode = Environment.BG_SKY
    var sky := Sky.new()
    var sky_material := PanoramaSkyMaterial.new()
    sky_material.panorama = load("res://hdri/sky.hdr")
    sky.sky_material = sky_material
    env.sky = sky
    
    env.ambient_light_source = Environment.AMBIENT_SOURCE_SKY
    env.ambient_light_sky_contribution = 1.0
    
    env.volumetric_fog_enabled = true
    env.volumetric_fog_density = 0.01
    env.volumetric_fog_albedo = Color(0.9, 0.9, 1.0)
```

### 8. ReflectionProbe
Use for localized reflections (mirrors, shiny floors). Keep on `UPDATE_ONCE` for performance.

```gdscript
extends ReflectionProbe

func _ready() -> void:
    size = Vector3(10, 5, 10)
    resolution = ReflectionProbe.RESOLUTION_512
    update_mode = ReflectionProbe.UPDATE_ONCE
```

### 9. Performance Optimization & Light Budgets
- DirectionalLight3D with shadows: 1-2
- OmniLight3D with shadows: 3-5
- SpotLight3D with shadows: 2-4
- OmniLight3D without shadows: 20-30
- SpotLight3D without shadows: 15-20

Disable shadows for distant lights dynamically:
```gdscript
extends OmniLight3D

@export var shadow_max_distance := 50.0

func _process(delta: float) -> void:
    var camera := get_viewport().get_camera_3d()
    if camera:
        var dist := global_position.distance_to(camera.global_position)
        shadow_enabled = (dist < shadow_max_distance)
```

### 10. Expert Techniques
- **Fake Global Illumination**: Duplicate main `DirectionalLight3D`, rotate 180° (pointing up), Shadows OFF, Specular 0.0, Energy 10-40%.
- **Simulating PCSS (Contact-Hardening Shadows)**: Use `light_size` on `OmniLight3D` (high performance cost, keep low). Use `distance_fade_enabled` to cull when out of range.
- **Light-Volume-Trigger**: Use `Area3D` triggers and `Tween`-driven `Camera3D` overrides to smoothly transition between lighting environments.
- **Lighting-Quality-Settings**: Manage complex lighting features at runtime using the `RenderingServer` API for direct engine control (e.g., `gi_set_use_half_resolution(true)`).

## Pitfalls
- **NEVER use VoxelGI without setting a proper extents** — Unbound VoxelGI tanks performance. Always set `size` to tightly fit your scene.
- **NEVER enable shadows on every light** — Each shadow-casting light is expensive. Use shadows sparingly: 1-2 DirectionalLights, ~3-5 OmniLights max.
- **NEVER forget directional_shadow_mode** — Default is ORTHOGONAL. For large outdoor scenes, use PARALLEL_4_SPLITS for better shadow quality at distance.
- **NEVER use LightmapGI for fully dynamic scenes** — Lightmaps are baked. Moving geometry won't receive updated lighting. Use VoxelGI or SDFGI instead.
- **NEVER set omni_range too large** — Light attenuation is quadratic. A range of 500 affects 785,000 sq units. Keep range as small as visually acceptable.
- **NEVER hide a Light node using the Visible property to exclude it from a Lightmap bake** — Hiding a light has no effect on the baker. You must change the light's Bake Mode to Disabled.
- **NEVER use VoxelGI with paper-thin walls** — VoxelGI evaluates lighting using a 3D grid. Thin walls (less than one voxel thick) will cause severe light leaking. Seal your geometry or place hidden thick MeshInstance3D blocks around the exterior.
- **NEVER leave shadow bias at default for cascades** — Default bias often causes Peter Panning or light leaking at split transitions. Tune bias per-light based on your scene's scale.
- **NEVER bake LightmapGI without a Denoiser** — Godot's baked lightmaps are noisy by default. Use OIDN or JNLM (in Project Settings) for professional results.
- **NEVER use real-time SDFGI on Mobile/Compatibility renderers** — It is a Forward+ exclusive feature. Use fake GI bounce lights for lower-end platforms.
- **NEVER use 'Update Continuity' in ReflectionProbes for performance** — Keep ReflectionProbes on 'Update Once' and trigger manual updates only when necessary.
- **NEVER use emissive-only fake panels when AreaLight3D gives correct falloff and shadow softness in Forward+**.

## Verification
1. **Check Light Budgets**: Ensure shadow-casting lights do not exceed recommended limits (1-2 Directional, 3-5 Omni, 2-4 Spot).
2. **Verify Shadow Cascades**: In Godot Editor, visually inspect shadow transitions at split distances (10m, 50m, 200m). Ensure no Peter Panning or light leaking at split transitions.
3. **Check VoxelGI Extents**: Ensure `size` tightly fits the room and no unbound VoxelGI nodes exist.
4. **Verify LightmapGI Bake Mode**: Ensure lights meant to be excluded from bake have Bake Mode set to Disabled, not just hidden via the Visible property.
5. **Verify SDFGI Renderer**: Confirm project is using Forward+ renderer if SDFGI is enabled.
