# QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python

## When to Use

Reach for QuTiP whenever the object you care about is a quantum state or operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and you need to evolve it, measure it, or visualize it. The library represents `Qobj` (quantum objects) together with their tensor-product *dimension* structure, so composite systems, partial traces, and superoperators all stay bookkeeping-correct without you tracking index order by hand.

Concretely, it fits when you are:

1. **Modeling closed (unitary) or open (dissipative) systems.** Closed systems conserve probability and you only need the Hamiltonian; open systems leak into an environment, so you also supply collapse operators. QuTiP lets you switch between the two by changing a single argument.
2. **Working with states and operators directly.** Kets, bras, and density matrices share one `Qobj` type, so the same code path handles pure and mixed states — important because real experiments almost always produce mixed states.
3. **Solving the Schrödinger or master equation for dynamics.** You rarely have closed-form solutions for driven or dissipative systems, so a numerical integrator is the practical tool.
4. **Quantifying quantum information** (entanglement, fidelity, von Neumann entropy). These scalar diagnostics let you compare a noisy simulation against an ideal target.
5. **Visualizing states** via Bloch spheres, Wigner functions, or Hinton diagrams, because a phase-phase or sphere picture often reveals structure (squeezing, interference fringes) that a raw density matrix hides.
6. **Running advanced dynamics** such as Floquet theory (periodic driving) or HEOM (strong, non-Markovian system–bath coupling) where the simple Born–Markov master equation is no longer valid.

### Do Not Use

- **Classical physics simulations.** QuTiP has no advantage over plain NumPy/SciPy for classical ODEs, and forcing classical problems through `Qobj` only adds overhead.
- **Large-scale circuit synthesis / transpilation.** Use the `qutip-qip` extension for small pedagogical circuits, but for hardware-targeted compilation prefer `qiskit` or `cirq`. The legacy `qutip-qip` namespace is deprecated; new code should import from `qutip_qip`.
- **Hilbert spaces that exceed available RAM.** A dense density matrix costs `O(d^2)` complex numbers, so a 10-qubit open system (`d = 1024`) already needs ~16 MB per stored matrix and far more transiently. Before scaling up, switch to sparse representations, Krylov-subspace methods (`options={"method": "krylov"}`), Monte-Carlo trajectories (state vectors instead of density matrices), or a GPU back-end.
- **Loading untrusted serialized objects.** `Qobj` pickles and `.qu` files can carry arbitrary Python objects. Deserializing attacker-controlled data is equivalent to running attacker code. Only load files whose provenance you trust, and prefer interchange formats (`.npy`, HDF5 with array-only payloads) for data from third parties.

## Prerequisites

### Installation

Pin to the 5.x series. QuTiP 5 changed several public APIs (solver options are now plain dictionaries, Floquet uses `FloquetBasis`, HEOM moved to `qutip.solver.heom`), so pinning a major version protects your scripts from silent breakage on the next release:

```bash
uv pip install "qutip>=5.0,<6.0"
```

Optional companion packages — install only what a given project needs, since each pulls in extra dependencies:

```bash
# Quantum information processing (circuits, gates) — modern namespace is `qutip_qip`
uv pip install "qutip-qip>=0.4"

# Optimal-control / pulse-engineering tools
uv pip install "qutip-qtrl>=0.3"
```

Verify the install and surface the exact version, because feature availability (Floquet, HEOM, solver option keys) differs across point releases:

```python
import qutip

print(f"QuTiP {qutip.__version__}")
# Run the built-in self-test on a fresh environment to catch a broken BLAS/SciPy link
# before it shows up as a wrong numerical answer.
# qutip.about()  # prints versions of NumPy, SciPy, Cython, and compiled extensions
```

### Coding Conventions

Every code block below is a complete, runnable snippet that follows three rules. Each rule prevents a specific, common failure mode:

1. **Explicit imports and explicit type hints (no `Any`).** `from qutip import *` pulls in names like `num`, `create`, and `position` that shadow ordinary identifiers and make it hard to tell where a symbol came from. Naming imports and annotating with concrete types (`Qobj`, `NDArray[np.float64]`, `list[Qobj]`) lets a type checker catch a ket/operator mix-up *before* you wait through a long integration.
2. **Validation at the boundary.** Numerical solvers do not reject unphysical input — a negative decay rate or mismatched Hilbert-space dimension produces a cryptic error deep in the integrator, or worse, a plausible-looking but wrong answer. Validating dimensions and rates where data enters the function converts those into clear, early errors.
3. **Defensive handling of solver output.** An ODE integrator that diverges returns `NaN` or `inf` rather than raising. Checking that results are finite (and, for steady states, that the residual is actually small) is the difference between trusting a number and being misled by one.

The examples share a small helper module. Save it once as `qutip_helpers.py`:

## Procedure

### 1. Quantum Objects and States

States and operators are both `Qobj` instances; the difference is encoded in the `.type` attribute and the `.dims` structure. Building them through small validated constructors keeps the *truncation dimension* explicit, which matters because every infinite-dimensional mode (a cavity, an oscillator) must be cut off somewhere, and choosing that cutoff too low silently corrupts the physics.

```python
from qutip import (
    Qobj,
    basis,
    coherent,
    thermal_dm,
    destroy,
    create,
    num,

    tensor,
)

    """Return the Fock (number) state |level> in a `dimension`-sized space."""
    require_dimension("dimension", dimension)
    if not isinstance(level, int) or not (0 <= level < dimension):
        raise ValueError(
            f"level must satisfy 0 <= level < {dimension}, got {level!r}"
        )
    return basis(dimension, level)


def coherent_state(dimension: int, alpha: complex) -> Qobj:
    """Return a coherent state |alpha> with a truncation safety check."""
    require_dimension("dimension", dimension)
    amplitude = complex(alpha)
    mean_photons = abs(amplitude) ** 2
    # A coherent state populates Fock levels up to ~|alpha|^2 with a spread of
    # ~|alpha|. If the truncation is too small the tail wraps around and aliases
    # back into low levels, so refuse rather than return a corrupted state.
    if mean_photons > 0.5 * dimension:
        raise ValueError(
            f"dimension={dimension} too small for <n>={mean_photons:.1f}; "
            f"use dimension >= {int(4 * mean_photons) + 1} to contain the tail"
        )
    return coherent(dimension, amplitude)


def thermal_state(dimension: int, mean_photons: float) -> Qobj:
    """Return a thermal density matrix with the given average occupation."""
    require_dimension("dimension", dimension)
    n_avg = require_nonnegative_rate("mean_photons", mean_photons)
    if n_avg > 0.25 * dimension:
        raise ValueError(
            f"dimension={dimension} too small for a thermal state with "
            f"<n>={n_avg:.1f}; increase the truncation"
        )
    return thermal_dm(dimension, n_avg)


def mode_operators(dimension: int) -> tuple[Qobj, Qobj, Qobj]:
    """Return (annihilation, creation, number) operators for one bosonic mode."""
    require_dimension("dimension", dimension)
    annihilation = destroy(dimension)
    creation = create(dimension)
    number = num(dimension)
    return annihilation, creation, number


def two_qubit_observable() -> Qobj:
    """Build sigma_z ⊗ I on a two-qubit space, demonstrating composition.

    `tensor` tracks the [[2, 2], [2, 2]] dims so later partial traces and
    expectation values address the correct subsystem automatically.
    """
    sz_on_first = tensor(sigmaz(), qeye(2))
    return sz_on_first


# Example usage
psi_fock = fock_state(dimension=20, level=2)            # |2>

### 2. Time Evolution and Dynamics

Pick the solver that matches the physics, not out of habit — the wrong choice is either needlessly slow or silently inapplicable. The wrapper below validates the model, supplies sane solver options as a QuTiP 5 dictionary, and verifies the output is finite so a diverged integration cannot masquerade as a result.

**Solver selection guide — and *why* each one exists:**

| Solver | Use case | Cost |
|--------|----------|------|
| `sesolve` | Pure states under unitary evolution. Propagates a state *vector* (`d` amplitudes). | Cheapest |
| `mesolve` | Mixed states and general dissipation. Propagates a *density matrix* (`d^2` numbers). | Exact ensemble-averaged dynamics |
| `mcsolve` | Stochastic quantum jumps. Averages many `d`-dimensional trajectories instead of storing one `d^2` matrix. | Wins on memory for large open systems; exposes individual quantum-jump records |
| `brmesolve` | Bloch–Redfield, for *weak* system–bath coupling specified through a noise spectrum rather than explicit collapse operators. | Use when you know the bath's spectral density but not a phenomenological decay rate |
| `fmmesolve` | Floquet–Markov, for time-*periodic* driving where dissipation is best treated in the Floquet basis. | For periodically driven open systems |

### 3. Analysis and Measurement

These functions turn a state into a scalar you can track or compare. Each guard reflects the domain of validity: entropy and concurrence require a *normalized density matrix*, fidelity requires two states on the *same* space, and a steady state is only trustworthy if its Liouvillian residual is actually near zero.

### 6. Two-Qubit Entanglement Dynamics (Complete Example)

Pure dephasing destroys the off-diagonal coherences of a Bell state without changing populations, so the concurrence should decay smoothly to zero. The Hamiltonian is set to zero deliberately, to isolate the effect of dephasing from any coherent rotation.

### 7. Jaynes–Cummings Model (Complete Example)

## Pitfalls

1. **Truncation dimension too small for coherent/thermal states.** A coherent state with `|alpha|^2` mean photons populates Fock levels up to `~|alpha|^2` with a spread of `~|alpha`. If the truncation is too small the tail wraps around and aliases back into low levels, silently corrupting the state. Always use `dimension >= 4 * |alpha|^2 + 1` for coherent states and check that `mean_photons <= 0.25 * dimension` for thermal states.

2. **Collapse operator dimensions mismatched with Hamiltonian.** This is the most common open-systems bug. The integrator turns a dimension mismatch into an inscrutable broadcasting error. Always validate `c_op.dims == hamiltonian.dims` before calling `mesolve`.

3. **Negative or non-finite rates passed to the master equation.** These correspond to an unphysical, norm-amplifying master equation; the integrator diverges silently rather than raising. Always validate rates are finite and non-negative at the boundary.

4. **Diverged integrator returning NaN/inf instead of raising.** An ODE integrator that diverges returns `NaN` or `inf` rather than raising an exception. Always check `np.all(np.isfinite(values))` on expectation series after solving. If divergence occurs, reduce the time step, lower the rates, or set `options['method']='bdf'`.

5. **Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian for standard time evolution.** A non-Hermitian Hamiltonian breaks unitarity and conservation of probability. Only relax the Hermiticity guard for deliberately non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonians (e.g. PT-symmetric models).

6. **Steady state with large Liouvillian residual.** `steadystate` may return a result even when the Liouvillian residual is not near zero. Always verify `(L * operator_to_vector(rho_ss)).norm() < 1e-6` after solving. A large residual means the Liouvillian is singular or the system lacks a unique steady state.

7. **Using `from qutip import *`.** This pulls in names like `num`, `create`, and `position` that shadow ordinary identifiers. Use explicit imports instead.

8. **Loading untrusted serialized `Qobj` pickles or `.qu` files.** These can carry arbitrary Python objects. Deserializing attacker-controlled data is equivalent to running attacker code. Only load files whose provenance you trust; prefer `.npy` or HDF5 with array-only payloads for third-party data.

9. **Exceeding RAM with dense density matrices.** A dense density matrix costs `O(d^2)` complex numbers. A 10-qubit open system (`d = 1024`) needs ~16 MB per stored matrix and far more transiently. Switch to sparse representations, Krylov-subspace methods (`options={"method": "krylov"}`), Monte-Carlo trajectories, or a GPU back-end before scaling up.

10. **Using deprecated `qutip.qip` namespace.** The legacy `qutip.qip` namespace is deprecated. New code should import from `qutip_qip` (the `qutip-qip` package, installed separately).

11. **QuTiP 5 API changes.** Solver options are now plain dictionaries (not `Options` objects). Floquet uses `FloquetBasis`. HEOM moved to `qutip.solver.heom`. Pin to `"qutip>=5.0,<6.0"` to protect scripts from silent breakage.

12. **Non-monotonic or single-point time grid.** QuTiP samples results at `tlist` points; a non-monotonic or single-point grid yields meaningless output rather than an error. Always validate `tlist` is 1-D, has at least two points, and is strictly increasing.

## Verification

1. **Install and confirm version:**
   ```bash
   uv pip install "qutip>=5.0,<6.0"
   python -c "import qutip; print(qutip.__version__)"
   ```
   Confirm a 5.x version is printed.

2. **Save and import helpers:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import qutip_helpers; print('helpers OK')"
   ```

3. **Run the damped oscillator example** and confirm `<n>(t)` tracks the analytic `|alpha|^2 * exp(-kappa * t)` envelope:
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from qutip import coherent, destroy, mesolve, num

   tlist = np.linspace(0.0, 50.0, 200)
   a = destroy(20)
   H = 1.0 * a.dag() * a
   c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.1) * a]
   psi0 = coherent(20, 3.0)
   result = mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops, [num(20)])
   n_t = result.expect[0]
   expected = 9.0 * np.exp(-0.1 * tlist)
   assert np.allclose(n_t, expected, atol=0.5), "photon decay does not match analytic envelope"
   print("damped oscillator: PASS")
   ```

4. **Run the two-qubit entanglement example** and confirm concurrence decays monotonically to ~0 and that `tensor()` produced the correct `[[2, 2], [2, 2]]` dims:
   ```python
   from qutip import bell_state, tensor, qeye, sigmaz, mesolve, concurrence
   import numpy as np

   psi0 = bell_state("00")
   H = 0.0 * tensor(qeye(2), qeye(2))
   c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.1) * tensor(sigmaz(), qeye(2)),
            np.sqrt(0.1) * tensor(qeye(2), sigmaz())]
   tlist = np.linspace(0.0, 10.0, 100)
   result = mesolve(H, psi0, tlist, c_ops, [], options={"store_states": True})
   concurrences = [concurrence(s) for s in result.states]
   assert concurrences[-1] < 0.1, "concurrence did not decay"
   assert concurrences[0] > 0.9, "initial state not maximally entangled"
   print("entanglement decay: PASS")
   ```

5. **Render a Bloch sphere headless** and confirm the file is written:
   ```python
   from qutip import basis, Bloch
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   b = Bloch()
   b.add_states(basis(2, 0))
   b.render()
   fig = plt.gcf()
   fig.savefig("bloch.png", dpi=150)
   plt.close(fig)
   import os; assert os.path.exists("bloch.png"), "bloch.png not written"
   print("bloch render: PASS")
   ```

6. **Call `steadystate` and confirm it returns without raising the residual-tolerance error:**
   ```python
   import numpy as np
   from qutip import num, destroy, liouvillian, steadystate, operator_to_vector

   a = destroy(10)
   H = num(10)
   c_ops = [np.sqrt(0.1) * a]
   L = liouvillian(H, c_ops)
   rho_ss = steadystate(L, method="svd", tol=1e-10)
   residual = (L * operator_to_vector(rho_ss)).norm()
   assert residual < 1e-6, f"steady-state residual {residual:.2e} too large"
   print(f"steady state: PASS (residual={residual:.2e})")
   ```
