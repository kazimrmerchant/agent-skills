# Snyk Security Audit Toolkit

Use this skill to run Snyk CLI scans across dependencies (SCA), source code (SAST), container images, and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC). Covers installation, authentication, core commands, CI/CD integration, and failure handling.

## When to Use

- Auditing package dependencies for known vulnerabilities (SCA).
- Running static code security checks on custom source (SAST).
- Inspecting Docker container layers and OS packages.
- Correcting IaC security misconfigurations (Terraform, Kubernetes, CloudFormation).
- Setting up Snyk in GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines.

**Route elsewhere:**
- `/setup-pre-commit` for formatting hooks.
- `/nodejs-best-practices` for general Node.js project configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 22/24 installed and available on PATH.
- A Snyk account or service account token.
- For dependency scans: a populated `node_modules` directory (run `npm install` / `pnpm install` first).
- For container scans: Docker runtime available and the target image pulled or built locally.
- Windows host is primary (PowerShell). Use PowerShell-compatible syntax for env vars and path separators.

## Procedure

### 1. Install the Snyk CLI

```powershell
# Install globally via NPM
npm install -g snyk

# Alternative (macOS/Linux): Homebrew
brew install snyk-cli
```

### 2. Authenticate

**Interactive (local dev):**

```powershell
snyk auth
```

This opens a browser login flow.

**Non-interactive (CI/CD or automated systems):**

Set the `SNYK_TOKEN` environment variable to a service account API token.

```powershell
# PowerShell
$env:SNYK_TOKEN = "YOUR_KEY"

# CI/CD (GitHub Actions): inject via repository secrets
# env:
#   SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
```

> **HARD RULE:** Never commit `SNYK_TOKEN` directly into shell scripts or repository YAML files. Always inject via CI environment secrets.

### 3. Scan Application Dependencies (SCA)

```powershell
# Basic project scan
snyk test

# Monorepo with multiple manifest files
snyk test --all-projects

# Fail only on high or critical severity
snyk test --severity-threshold=high

# Reachability analysis (verify if vulnerable deps are actually imported)
snyk test --reachability=true

# Continuous monitoring: upload package mappings to Snyk dashboard
snyk monitor
```

### 4. Scan Custom Source Code (SAST)

```powershell
snyk code test
```

### 5. Scan Container Images

```powershell
# Remote public image
snyk container test node:22-alpine

# Local image with Dockerfile for root-layer tracing
snyk container test custom-app:latest --file=Dockerfile
```

> **HARD RULE:** Run container scans using the active deployment Dockerfile to ensure layer trace visibility.

### 6. Scan Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

```powershell
snyk iac test ./infrastructure/terraform/
```

### 7. GitHub Actions CI/CD Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/snyk-security.yml
name: Snyk Security Verification
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, release]

jobs:
  security-audit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Configure Node.js Environment
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '22'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Clean Install Package Dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run Snyk Dependency Audit
        uses: snyk/actions/node@master
        env:
          SNYK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SNYK_TOKEN }}
        with:
          args: --severity-threshold=high --exit-code=1
```

### 8. Output Contract (Standard Scan Summary JSON)

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "id": "SNYK-JS-LIBRARYNAME-123456",
      "title": "Prototype Pollution",
      "severity": "high",
      "packageName": "library-name",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "fixedIn": ["1.0.4"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pitfalls

- **Raw Token Storage:** Committing `SNYK_TOKEN` into shell scripts or repo YAML. Always use CI environment secrets.
- **Scanning Missing Trees:** Running `snyk test` before installing packages (`npm install` / `pnpm install`). Snyk requires a populated dependency tree on disk to map imports accurately.
- **Pipeline Over-testing:** Running full scans on every push across minor dev branches. This exhausts monthly free-tier API quotas. Run scans on PR validation gates instead.
- **Lockfile Integrity:** Modifying `package.json` without regenerating the lockfile breaks dependency integrity tests. Always update lockfiles directly.
- **Severity Noise:** Default scans surface low-severity warnings that can fail pipelines unnecessarily. Use `--severity-threshold=high` (or critical) in build scripts.
- **API Quota Block:** If unauthenticated rate limit blocks execution, verify `SNYK_TOKEN` is set and valid.

## Verification

### Confirm CLI is installed and authenticated

```powershell
snyk --version
```

Expected: a version string (e.g. `1.1290.0` or similar).

### Confirm authentication status

```powershell
snyk auth status
```

Expected: confirmation that the current token is valid and linked to an organization.

### Run a test scan and inspect output

```powershell
snyk test --severity-threshold=high
```

Expected: JSON or human-readable summary with `"ok": true` when no high/critical vulnerabilities are found, or a list of vulnerabilities with `id`, `severity`, `packageName`, `version`, and `fixedIn` fields.

### Verify CI integration

Trigger a pull request against `main` or `release` and confirm the `Snyk Security Verification` workflow runs and either passes or blocks based on `--severity-threshold=high --exit-code=1`.
