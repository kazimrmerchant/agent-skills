# Mesh Memory

Mesh Memory is a self-hosted semantic memory service with a built-in MCP server. It stores documents (worklogs, decisions, notes, research) in PostgreSQL with pgvector and retrieves them by meaning — a query like "what database did we pick?" surfaces a saved note that says "chose Redis for caching" even with zero keyword overlap. Embeddings are generated locally with `multilingual-e5-base` (768 dimensions); the core flow requires no external API keys.

## When to Use

- **Saving a session worklog, decision, or research note** so a later session can find it.
- **Recalling past work by topic** when you do not remember the exact words you used.
- **Sharing a long-lived knowledge base** across multiple agents, terminals, or teammates.
- **Organizing context by role or project** through workspaces (one workspace per role/project).
- **Looking up structured tags** (e.g. all `type:decision` entries from one project).

Trigger keywords: *remember this, recall, what did we decide, save worklog, persistent memory, cross-session, knowledge base, mesh_add, mesh_search, mesh_focus.*

## Prerequisites

1. **A running Mesh Memory instance** reachable from the MCP server. Local Docker is the common path:
   ```powershell
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   See https://github.com/dklymentiev/mesh-memory for the full Quick Start.
2. **The MCP server** (`mcp_server.py`) registered with your client (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, or any other MCP-aware agent).
3. **`MESH_API_URL`** pointing at the running instance (default: `http://localhost:8000`).
4. **Python 3** available on PATH for the MCP server process.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Register the MCP server

Add the server to your client's MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mesh": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["/path/to/mesh-memory/mcp_server.py"],
      "env": {
        "MESH_API_URL": "http://localhost:8000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows (PowerShell), adjust the path to the Windows-style location, e.g. `C:\\path\\to\\mesh-memory\\mcp_server.py`, and ensure `python3` resolves (or use `python`).

### Step 2 — Verify the instance is reachable

```powershell
curl $MESH_API_URL/health
```

Expected output:
```json
{"status":"healthy"}
```

If this fails, the MCP server cannot reach the backend — see Pitfalls.

### Step 3 — Use the 13 MCP tools

When the server is reachable, these tools become available:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mesh_focus` | Switch the active workspace (optionally prefetch recent docs). |
| `mesh_add` | Save a document with optional tags. Auto-adds `date:YYYY-MM-DD` and `source:`. |
| `mesh_update` | Update content, tags, or pinned status of an existing document. |
| `mesh_delete` | Delete a document by GUID. |
| `mesh_get` | Fetch a single document by GUID. |
| `mesh_search` | Semantic search by query, optionally across multiple workspaces with weights. |
| `mesh_bytag` | List documents that match one or more tags (AND logic). |
| `mesh_recent` | List most recently created documents, optionally filtered by `type:` tag. |
| `mesh_projects` | List per-project document counts (uses `guid:` tag as project marker). |
| `mesh_tags` | List existing tags with counts; optional prefix filter. |
| `mesh_versions` | Show the version chain of a document (similarity-linked revisions). |
| `mesh_stats` | Memory statistics for the active workspace. |
| `mesh_schema` | Show the tag schema (recognized prefixes and types). |

### Step 4 — Save a session worklog

After completing work, persist it for future sessions:

```
mesh_add(
  content="Investigated 502s on the checkout flow. Root cause: missing CORS header on the cart API. Fix shipped in commit abc123.",
  tags="type:worklog,topic:checkout,date:2026-05-23",
  workspace="developer"
)
```

`date:` and `source:` are added automatically when omitted. Type and topic tags are inferred from nearest neighbors after the embedding completes — **5–10 seed documents are required** before inference kicks in.

### Step 5 — Recall past work by meaning

Search across sessions for related context, even with different vocabulary:

```
mesh_search(query="checkout was failing for some users", limit=5, workspace="developer")
```

The query shares no keywords with the original note ("502s", "CORS"), but embedding-based search surfaces it.

### Step 6 — Switch role / context

For a multi-role agent, switch the active workspace at the start of a session:

```
mesh_focus(workspace="sysadmin", prefetch=true, limit=5)
```

Subsequent calls default to that workspace. **Pin a role-prompt document** at the top of each workspace so the agent re-orients on every prefetch.

### Step 7 — Cross-workspace search with weights

To pull context from related domains without diluting the primary signal:

```
mesh_search(
  query="nginx rate limit recipe",
  workspaces={"sysadmin": 0.7, "security": 0.2, "developer": 0.1},
  limit=10
)
```

Results are merged across workspaces and re-scored by workspace weight.

### Step 8 — Structured lookups by tag

When you need an exact filter rather than semantic similarity:

```
mesh_bytag(tags="type:decision,status:active,guid:my-project", limit=20)
```

## Tag Conventions

Mesh accepts arbitrary tags. The recommended prefixes (used by auto-inference and surfaced by `mesh_schema`):

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `type:worklog` | Completed work; the most common type. |
| `type:note` | Quick notes, observations. |
| `type:decision` | Architecture or product decisions. |
| `type:research` | Investigation results, findings. |
| `type:task` | Action items. |
| `type:rfc` | Proposals for review. |
| `status:active` / `status:completed` / `status:archived` | Lifecycle. |
| `date:YYYY-MM-DD` | When the document was created (auto-added). |
| `source:` | How the document arrived (auto-added: `mcp`, `api`, etc.). |
| `guid:<project-id>` | Project marker — use a consistent slug across all docs of a project. |

**HARD RULE:** With fewer than ~5–10 documents in a workspace, neighbor inference is skipped. Manually tag seed documents until the corpus self-organizes.

## Examples

### Example 1 — Save a decision

```
mesh_add(
  content="Chose Redis for caching layer. Evaluated Memcached but Redis gave us persistence and pub/sub for free.",
  tags="type:decision,topic:caching,guid:checkout-redesign",
  workspace="developer"
)
```

### Example 2 — Recall that decision by meaning

```
mesh_search(query="what database did we pick for caching", workspace="developer", limit=3)
```

No keyword overlap with "Redis" or "Memcached," but semantic search surfaces the decision.

### Example 3 — List all active decisions for a project

```
mesh_bytag(tags="type:decision,status:active,guid:checkout-redesign", limit=20)
```

## Pitfalls

1. **Tool calls fail with connection errors.** The MCP server cannot reach `MESH_API_URL`. Verify the instance is up (`curl $MESH_API_URL/health` returns `{"status":"healthy"}`) and the env var is set in the MCP config block.

2. **A saved document does not appear in semantic search yet.** Embedding generation runs in the background. After a save, expect a **1–2 second delay** before semantic search hits the new document. Use `mesh_get(guid=...)` to confirm the document exists immediately.

3. **Search returns results from the wrong domain.** The active workspace is not what you expected. Call `mesh_focus(workspace="<name>")` explicitly, or pass `workspace=` on every call. With no focus and no explicit param, calls land in the `default` workspace.

4. **Auto-tagging never adds anything.** The workspace has too few documents for neighbor inference (~5–10 minimum). Manually tag a handful of seed documents, then auto-inference takes over.

5. **A deleted document still appears in a search result.** Embedding indices are eventually consistent; rerun the search after a few seconds, or use `mesh_get(guid=...)` to confirm deletion.

6. **Mesh is a knowledge store, not a chat memory.** Long conversation transcripts should be summarized before being saved — do not dump raw transcripts.

7. **High-precision lookups need tags, not vectors.** Vector similarity is robust but not perfect; for exact structured queries, prefer `mesh_bytag` over `mesh_search`.

8. **CPU-only embeddings by default.** Very large corpora (hundreds of thousands of documents) benefit from a dedicated instance and pgvector tuning — not covered here.

9. **Optional AI categorizer is disabled by default.** It requires an OpenAI-compatible LLM endpoint. The core flow (local embeddings, search, tagging) works without it.

## Verification

1. **Check instance health:**
   ```powershell
   curl $MESH_API_URL/health
   ```
   Expected: `{"status":"healthy"}`

2. **Confirm a saved document exists immediately after add:**
   ```
   mesh_get(guid="<returned-guid>")
   ```
   Expected: the document content and tags are returned.

3. **Confirm semantic search finds it (after 1–2 s):**
   ```
   mesh_search(query="<paraphrased query with no keyword overlap>", limit=5)
   ```
   Expected: the document appears in results.

4. **Check workspace stats:**
   ```
   mesh_stats()
   ```
   Expected: document count, tag count, and workspace name match expectations.

5. **Verify tag schema is loaded:**
   ```
   mesh_schema()
   ```
   Expected: recognized prefixes (`type:`, `status:`, `date:`, `source:`, `guid:`) are listed.
