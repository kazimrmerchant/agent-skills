# Particle Systems in Godot 4.3+

All examples target Godot 4.3+ and avoid deprecated APIs. The particle stack was reworked in Godot 4 (process logic moved into `ParticleProcessMaterial`, and `Particles*` nodes were renamed to `GPUParticles*`), so 3.x tutorials reference properties that no longer exist. Each example is shown in GDScript first, then C#, because the two share identical concepts but differ in casing and null-handling idioms.

> **Related skills:** **shader-basics** for custom particle shaders, **3d-essentials** for lighting and environment that affect particles, **2d-essentials** for 2D rendering context, **tween-animation** for code-driven VFX timing, **godot-optimization** for particle performance tuning.

## When to Use

Reach for this skill when an effect is *visual flavor* rather than *gameplay state* — something the player sees but the simulation does not depend on. Concretely:

- **Environmental ambiance** (fire, smoke, rain, dust): continuous emitters that run for the lifetime of a scene. These tell the player where they are and whether a space is safe or hostile.
- **Combat and interaction feedback** (explosions, impact sparks, magic): short, loud bursts that confirm "something happened." Feedback timing matters more than realism, so these lean on `one_shot` + `explosiveness`.
- **Polish layers** (trails, subemitters, turbulence): secondary motion that makes a base effect feel alive instead of static.
- **Performance-tuned variants**: the same effect authored at several quality tiers so it can scale from desktop GPUs down to web/mobile.

### Do NOT use for:

- **High-count systems on CPU when a GPU is available.** CPU particles run every particle's physics on the main thread — a few thousand will stall your frame while the GPU sits idle. `GPUParticles` offload that work to the graphics card and scale to tens of thousands cheaply.
- **Reading GPU particle positions for gameplay logic.** GPU particle state lives in VRAM and is never read back to the CPU. There is no real-time `get_particle_position()` in GDScript/C#. If you need exact positions (spawning loot where a spark landed, hit detection), use `Area2D`/`Area3D` physics nodes, or fall back to `CPUParticles` when the count is small enough that readback is affordable.
- **Trails or attractors under the Compatibility renderer.** Those features depend on compute/advanced rendering paths that only Forward+ and Mobile implement. The Compatibility renderer does not error — it silently ignores them — so an effect that looks correct in the editor can ship broken on a web export. Always verify on your real target.
- **Brute-forcing density by cranking `amount`.** Each particle costs fill rate (overdraw) regardless of processing backend. Doubling `amount` to fix a "too sparse" look often just halves your framerate on weaker GPUs. Tune `lifetime`, scale, and the emission shape first.
- **Using `fixed_fps` for precise timing.** Locking the update rate too low makes fast effects stutter when the real framerate drifts. Leave it at `0` (match render FPS) and use `speed_scale` for global time control such as slow-mo.
- **Setting `color` while using a `color_ramp`.** `color` is multiplied over every frame of the ramp, so a leftover tint skews the whole gradient. Always reset `color` to white (`Color.WHITE` / `Colors.White`) before assigning a ramp.

## Prerequisites

- **Godot 4.3 or later.** The particle API was reworked in Godot 4; 3.x properties do not exist.
- **Renderer awareness:** Trails, attractors, and collision require **Forward+** or **Mobile** renderer. The **Compatibility** renderer silently ignores these features.
- **Node naming convention:** Examples assume a child node named `GPUParticles2D` (or `GPUParticles3D`). Adjust the node path in `get_node_or_null` / `GetNodeOrNull` if your scene uses a different name.
- **Windows host (PowerShell):** When running Godot from the command line on Windows, use PowerShell syntax. Example: `& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" --path .` to launch the project editor.

## Procedure

### 1. Choose GPU vs CPU Particles

| Node                | Processing | Features                                | Use For                        |
|---------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `GPUParticles2D`    | GPU        | Full features, high counts, trails      | Most 2D effects                |
| `GPUParticles3D`    | GPU        | Full features, attractors, collision    | Most 3D effects                |
| `CPUParticles2D`    | CPU        | Simpler, no trails/attractors           | Low-end devices, few particles |
| `CPUParticles3D`    | CPU        | Simpler, no trails/attractors           | Low-end devices, few particles |

**Rule of thumb:** Default to GPU particles. The GPU processes particles in parallel and never blocks game logic. Switch to CPU particles only when (a) targeting hardware without a capable renderer (some web/low-end devices), or (b) you genuinely need the CPU to know where each particle is (e.g. spawning a node at a particle's location).

> You can convert between GPU and CPU particles in the editor: select the node → toolbar → **Convert to CPUParticles2D/3D** (or vice versa). This copies equivalent settings.

### 2. Understand the Architecture

A particle node separates *behavior* from *appearance*:

```
GPUParticles2D/3D
├── Process Material (ParticleProcessMaterial)   ← physics, emission, color
├── Draw Pass 1 (Mesh)                           ← what each particle looks like
└── (Optional) Draw Pass 2-4                     ← additional meshes per particle
```

### 3. Minimal Node Setup

1. Add a **GPUParticles2D** (or 3D) node.
2. In Inspector → Process Material → **New ParticleProcessMaterial**. Without a process material the node emits nothing.
3. Set **Amount** (particles alive at once). Start low and raise only if the effect reads as too sparse.
4. Configure emission, direction, velocity, gravity (see below).
5. (2D) Set **Texture** for particle appearance (e.g. `Texture2D` or `AtlasTexture`).
6. (3D) Set **Draw Pass 1** mesh (e.g. `QuadMesh` for camera-facing billboards, or a custom mesh for volumetric debris).

### 4. Configure Key Node Properties

These live on the `GPUParticles2D/3D` node itself (not the material):

| Property          | Type     | Description                                         |
|-------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `emitting`        | `bool`   | Start/stop emission                                 |
| `amount`          | `int`    | Total particles alive at once                       |
| `lifetime`        | `float`  | Seconds each particle lives                         |
| `one_shot`        | `bool`   | Emit once then stop                                 |
| `preprocess`      | `float`  | Simulate this many seconds before the first frame   |
| `speed_scale`     | `float`  | Time multiplier for particle physics                |
| `explosiveness`   | `float`  | 0.0 = spread over lifetime, 1.0 = all at once       |
| `fixed_fps`       | `int`    | Lock particle update rate (0 = match render FPS)    |
| `local_coords`    | `bool`   | Particles move with the node (true) or stay in world (false) |
| `draw_order`      | `enum`   | Index, Lifetime, or Reverse Lifetime                |
| `amount_ratio`    | `float`  | Fraction of particles to emit (0.0–1.0)             |
| `visibility_aabb` | `AABB`   | (3D) Custom bounding box for culling. Auto-calculated by default. |
| `visibility_rect` | `Rect2`  | (2D) Custom bounding rectangle for culling. Auto-calculated by default. |

### 5. Wire Up One-Shot vs Continuous Emission

A continuous emitter is simply switched `emitting` on. A one-shot emitter must be **armed and restarted** each time you want a fresh burst — otherwise a second trigger does nothing because the system already ran to completion.

The script below resolves the child node once via `get_node_or_null`, asserts the dependency in debug builds, and guards every public method so a missing node produces a clear log line rather than a crash.

```gdscript
extends Node2D
## Drives a single GPUParticles2D child for both continuous and burst use.

@onready var _particles: GPUParticles2D = get_node_or_null(^"GPUParticles2D")

func _ready() -> void:
	assert(_particles != null, "FireEffect expects a GPUParticles2D child named 'GPUParticles2D'")

func start_continuous() -> void:
	if _particles == null:
		push_error("start_continuous: particle node is missing")
		return
	_particles.one_shot = false
	_particles.emitting = true

func stop_continuous() -> void:
	if _particles == null:
		return
	_particles.emitting = false

func trigger_burst() -> void:
	# restart() rewinds the simulation to t=0 so a brand-new burst plays on every
	# call, even if a previous burst is still mid-flight.
	if _particles == null:
		push_error("trigger_burst: particle node is missing")
		return
	_particles.one_shot = true
	_particles.restart()
	_particles.emitting = true
```

```csharp
using Godot;

public partial class FireEffect : Node2D
{
    private GpuParticles2D _particles;

    public override void _Ready()
    {
        _particles = GetNodeOrNull<GpuParticles2D>("GPUParticles2D");
        if (_particles is null)
        {
            GD.PushError("FireEffect expects a GpuParticles2D child named 'GPUParticles2D'.");
        }
    }

    public void StartContinuous()
    {
        if (_particles is null)
        {
            GD.PushError("StartContinuous: particle node is missing.");
            return;
        }
        _particles.OneShot = false;
        _particles.Emitting = true;
    }

    public void StopContinuous()
    {
        if (_particles is null) return;
        _particles.Emitting = false;
    }

    public void TriggerBurst()
    {
        if (_particles is null)
        {
            GD.PushError("TriggerBurst: particle node is missing.");
            return;
        }
        _particles.OneShot = true;
        _particles.Restart();
        _particles.Emitting = true;
    }
}
```

### 6. Spawn and Auto-Free Transient Bursts

Transient effects (explosions, footstep puffs) are instanced at a world position, played once, and discarded. If you forget the discard step they accumulate in the tree and leak memory.

```gdscript
## Spawns a one-shot burst at a world position and frees it after it finishes.
func spawn_burst(burst_scene: PackedScene, world_position: Vector2) -> void:
	assert(burst_scene != null, "spawn_burst requires a non-null PackedScene")
	if burst_scene == null:
		push_error("spawn_burst: burst_scene is null")
		return

	var instance: Node = burst_scene.instantiate()
	var particles := instance as GPUParticles2D
	if particles == null:
		push_error("spawn_burst: scene root is not a GPUParticles2D")
		instance.queue_free()
		return

	particles.global_position = world_position
	particles.one_shot = true
	add_child(particles)
	particles.restart()
	particles.emitting = true

	# Free after the last particle dies. +0.5s margin absorbs frame-timing jitter.
	var cleanup_delay: float = particles.lifetime + 0.5
	get_tree().create_timer(cleanup_delay).timeout.connect(particles.queue_free)
```

```csharp
using System;
using Godot;

public partial class BurstSpawner : Node2D
{
    public void SpawnBurst(PackedScene burstScene, Vector2 worldPosition)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(burstScene);

        Node instance = burstScene.Instantiate();
        if (instance is not GpuParticles2D particles)
        {
            GD.PushError("SpawnBurst: scene root is not a GpuParticles2D.");
            instance.QueueFree();
            return;
        }

        particles.GlobalPosition = worldPosition;
        particles.OneShot = true;
        AddChild(particles);
        particles.Restart();
        particles.Emitting = true;

        float cleanupDelay = particles.Lifetime + 0.5f;
        SceneTreeTimer timer = GetTree().CreateTimer(cleanupDelay);
        timer.Timeout += particles.QueueFree;
    }
}
```

### 7. Build a ParticleProcessMaterial (Factory Pattern)

Rather than mutating a material inline, use **pure factory functions** that build and return a fully configured `ParticleProcessMaterial`. Each validates its inputs so degenerate values are caught at the call site.

#### Emission Shape

The emission shape defines *where* particles are born — the single biggest factor in an effect's silhouette.

| Shape             | Description                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Point`           | All particles spawn at the origin              |
| `Sphere`          | Random position within a sphere volume         |
| `Sphere Surface`  | Random position on the sphere surface only     |
| `Box`             | Random position within a box volume            |
| `Ring`            | Random position on a ring/torus                |
| `Points`          | Spawn at positions sampled from a texture/mesh |
| `Directed Points` | Spawn at positions with normals from a mesh    |

```gdscript
class_name FireMaterialFactory
extends RefCounted
## Pure builders for a fire ParticleProcessMaterial.

static func _make_sphere_emitter(radius: float) -> ParticleProcessMaterial:
	assert(radius > 0.0, "Emission sphere radius must be > 0, got %f" % radius)
	var mat := ParticleProcessMaterial.new()
	mat.emission_shape = ParticleProcessMaterial.EMISSION_SHAPE_SPHERE
	mat.emission_sphere_radius = maxf(radius, 0.0001)
	return mat
```

```csharp
using System;
using Godot;

public static class FireMaterialFactory
{
    private static ParticleProcessMaterial MakeSphereEmitter(float radius)
    {
        if (radius <= 0.0f)
        {
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(
                nameof(radius), radius, "Emission sphere radius must be greater than 0.");
        }

        return new ParticleProcessMaterial
        {
            EmissionShape = ParticleProcessMaterial.EmissionShapeEnum.Sphere,
            EmissionSphereRadius = radius,
        };
    }
}
```

#### Direction, Velocity & Gravity

`direction` + `spread` set the cone particles launch into; velocity range sets speed; gravity bends the path over time. Enforce `min <= max` because an inverted range doesn't error — Godot samples a meaningless range and the speed variation disappears.

```gdscript
static func _configure_motion(mat: ParticleProcessMaterial, min_speed: float, max_speed: float) -> void:
	assert(mat != null, "_configure_motion requires a ParticleProcessMaterial")
	assert(min_speed >= 0.0, "Minimum velocity cannot be negative, got %f" % min_speed)
	assert(max_speed >= min_speed, "Maximum velocity must be >= minimum velocity")

	mat.direction = Vector3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0)   # upward
	mat.spread = 30.0                          # degrees of cone scatter
	mat.initial_velocity_min = min_speed
	mat.initial_velocity_max = max_speed
	mat.gravity = Vector3(0.0, -9.8, 0.0)      # Earth gravity
```

```csharp
    private static void ConfigureMotion(ParticleProcessMaterial material, float minSpeed, float maxSpeed)
    {
        ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull(material);
        if (minSpeed < 0.0f)
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(minSpeed), minSpeed, "Minimum velocity cannot be negative.");
        if (maxSpeed < minSpeed)
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(maxSpeed), maxSpeed, "Maximum velocity must be >= minimum velocity.");

        material.Direction = new Vector3(0.0f, 1.0f, 0.0f);
        material.Spread = 30.0f;
        material.InitialVelocityMin = minSpeed;
        material.InitialVelocityMax = maxSpeed;
        material.Gravity = new Vector3(0.0f, -9.8f, 0.0f);
    }
```

#### Scale Over Lifetime

`scale_min`/`scale_max` set each particle's base size at birth. `scale_curve` multiplies that base by a factor sampled across the particle's **normalized age** (0.0 = birth, 1.0 = death). Shrinking the curve to 0 at death makes particles fade out by size instead of popping.

#### Color Over Lifetime

**HARD RULE:** Always reset `color` to `Color.WHITE` / `Colors.White` before assigning a `color_ramp`. A leftover `color` tint is multiplied over every frame of the ramp and skews the entire gradient.

### 8. Load Reference Files for Advanced Features

Load these reference files from `references/` when you need the corresponding feature:

| Feature | Reference File | When to Load |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Fire, explosion, dust recipes | `references/vfx-recipes.md` | When implementing any of the three core VFX recipes with full GDScript wiring and recommended `ParticleProcessMaterial` settings |
| Trails | `references/trails.md` | When setting up `trail_enabled` with `RibbonTrailMesh` or `TubeTrailMesh`; includes trail-mesh-type comparison |
| Subemitters | `references/subemitters.md` | When a particle needs to spawn another particle scene at birth/collision/death; includes trigger modes, scene setup, and limitations |
| Attractors & Collision | `references/attractors-and-collision.md` | When using `GPUParticlesAttractor*3D` or `GPUParticlesCollision*3D`; includes full setup of each type |
| Flipbook Animation | `references/flipbook-animation.md` | When using sprite-sheet animated particles; includes `CanvasItemMaterial` frame layout setup |

### 9. Trails (Forward+ and Mobile ONLY)

Set `trail_enabled = true` on `GPUParticles2D/3D` and assign a trail `Mesh`:
- `RibbonTrailMesh` for flat 2D-style ribbons
- `TubeTrailMesh` for volumetric 3D trails

Also set `trail_material` on the node and tune `trail_section_length` (shorter = smoother but more geometry). **The Compatibility renderer will show nothing** — trails require Forward+ or Mobile.

> **Load `references/trails.md`** for the full setup and trail-mesh-type comparison.

### 10. Subemitters

A particle can spawn *another* particle scene at lifecycle events (birth, collision, death, or manual trigger). Configure via `ParticleProcessMaterial.sub_emitter_mode` plus the `sub_emitter` property on the parent node, which expects a `PackedScene` whose root is another `GPUParticles` node.

> **Load `references/subemitters.md`** for trigger modes, scene setup, GDScript/C# parity, and limitations.

### 11. Attractors & Collision (3D, Forward+/Mobile ONLY)

- `GPUParticlesAttractor*3D` (Box / Sphere / Vector Field): pulls particles toward a region.
- `GPUParticlesCollision*3D` (Box / Sphere / SDF / HeightField): lets particles bounce off geometry.

**HARD RULE:** The particles themselves must opt in. Enable `attractor_interaction_enabled` and `collision_mode` on the `ParticleProcessMaterial`, or the attractor/collider nodes will have no effect even when present in the scene. No 2D equivalents exist.

> **Load `references/attractors-and-collision.md`** for full setup of each attractor and collision type.

### 12. Turbulence

Set `turbulence_enabled = true` on the `ParticleProcessMaterial` and tune:
- `turbulence_noise_strength` (0.5–2.0 typical)
- `turbulence_noise_scale` (lower = larger, slower swirls)
- `turbulence_noise_speed` (animates the noise field over time)
- `turbulence_noise_offset` (decorrelate multiple emitters so they don't swirl in sync)

### 13. Flipbook Animation (2D)

Two cooperating settings drive sprite-sheet animated particles:
- `ParticleProcessMaterial.anim_speed_min`/`anim_speed_max`: how fast a particle advances through frames over its lifetime.
- `CanvasItemMaterial.particles_anim_h_frames`/`particles_anim_v_frames`: the sheet's grid layout.

Apply the `CanvasItemMaterial` to the `GPUParticles2D` node's `material` property, or the frame layout is never read and every particle shows the whole sheet.

> **Load `references/flipbook-animation.md`** for the full setup with GDScript + C# parity.

## Examples

### Common VFX Recipes

- **Fire** (2D): continuous emitter with hot-to-cool color ramp and scale-down curve. Continuous because flame is ongoing; the ramp + shrink sell the rising, cooling motion.
- **Explosion burst** (3D or 2D): `one_shot = true` with high `amount`, short `lifetime`, `explosiveness = 1.0` so every particle launches on the same frame. An explosion that lingers reads as slow and unconvincing.
- **Dust / footstep puff**: small `one_shot` burst that scales *up* while fading alpha to 0, mimicking how a real puff expands and dissipates.

> **Load `references/vfx-recipes.md`** for ready-to-use, fully-typed GDScript wiring and recommended `ParticleProcessMaterial` settings for all three.

## Pitfalls

1. **Compatibility renderer silently drops trails, attractors, and collision.** No error is printed. An effect that looks correct in the editor (Forward+) can ship broken to a web export (Compatibility). Always test on your actual export target.

2. **Forgetting `restart()` on one-shot bursts.** A one-shot system that already ran to completion will emit nothing on a second `emitting = true`. Always call `restart()` before re-arming.

3. **Leaking transient particle instances.** One-shot bursts instanced at runtime must be `queue_free()`d after `lifetime + margin`. Without this, they accumulate in the scene tree and leak memory.

4. **Setting `color` while using `color_ramp`.** The `color` property is multiplied over every frame of the ramp. Always reset to `Color.WHITE` / `Colors.White` before assigning a ramp.

5. **Cranking `amount` to fix sparse-looking effects.** Each particle costs fill rate (overdraw). Doubling `amount` often halves framerate on weaker GPUs. Tune `lifetime`, scale, and emission shape first.

6. **Using `fixed_fps` for timing control.** A low fixed rate makes fast effects stutter when real framerate drifts. Leave at `0` and use `speed_scale` for slow-mo or global time control.

7. **Expecting GPU particle readback.** GPU particle state lives in VRAM and is never read back to the CPU. There is no `get_particle_position()`. Use `Area2D`/`Area3D` for gameplay-relevant hit detection, or `CPUParticles` for small-count position access.

8. **Missing opt-in for attractors/collision.** Attractor and collider nodes in the scene have zero effect unless `attractor_interaction_enabled` and `collision_mode` are set on the `ParticleProcessMaterial`.

9. **Wrong `local_coords` setting.** `true` for effects attached to a moving emitter (exhaust on a car); `false` for world-anchored effects (rain, ground dust). Getting this wrong makes particles either drag incorrectly or stay frozen in world space.

10. **Missing `preprocess` on ambient effects.** Without `preprocess`, fire/smoke/dust start from empty on the first frame the player sees them. Set `preprocess` to a value ≥ `lifetime` so they appear already-running.

11. **Flipbook `CanvasItemMaterial` not applied.** If the `CanvasItemMaterial` with `particles_anim_h_frames`/`particles_anim_v_frames` is not set on the `GPUParticles2D` node's `material` property, every particle shows the whole sprite sheet instead of individual frames.

## Verification

Work through this checklist before considering a particle effect "done." Each item maps to a concrete failure it prevents:

- [ ] Particle `amount` is the minimum that still reads correctly — extra particles cost overdraw every frame.
- [ ] `lifetime` matches the intended visual duration — neither vanishing abruptly nor lingering and cluttering.
- [ ] `one_shot` is enabled for burst effects **and** `restart()` is called on each trigger.
- [ ] `preprocess` is set for always-visible ambient effects so they appear already-running on the first frame.
- [ ] Emission shape matches the source geometry (sphere for explosions, box for area fog).
- [ ] `color_ramp` fades alpha to 0 at the end so particles dissolve smoothly.
- [ ] `scale_curve` shrinks (or grows-then-fades for puffs) particles over lifetime.
- [ ] `local_coords` is set intentionally — `true` for moving emitters, `false` for world-anchored effects.
- [ ] One-shot particles are freed with `queue_free()` after `lifetime` + margin.
- [ ] `visibility_rect` (2D) or `visibility_aabb` (3D) is sized to the effect's real extent.
- [ ] `fixed_fps` is left at `0` unless you have a specific reason to lock it.
- [ ] Renderer-dependent features (trails, attractors, collision) are confirmed working on the actual export target — not just the editor.
- [ ] `color` is reset to `Color.WHITE` / `Colors.White` before assigning a `color_ramp`.
- [ ] Attractor/collision opt-in flags (`attractor_interaction_enabled`, `collision_mode`) are set on the `ParticleProcessMaterial` when using attractor/collider nodes.
- [ ] Dynamic quality scaling is wired up — lowering `amount_ratio` or substituting `CPUParticles` on web/low-end targets so the effect degrades gracefully.

### Quick Runtime Check (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Launch the project and check for particle-related errors in the editor log
& "C:\Program Files\Godot\Godot_v4.3-stable_win64.exe" --path . --verbose 2>&1 | Select-String -Pattern "particle|Particle|GPU|trail|attractor|collision"
```

If the output contains warnings about unsupported features under the Compatibility renderer, switch the project renderer to Forward+ or Mobile, or remove the renderer-dependent features for that export target.
