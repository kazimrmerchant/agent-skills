# Technical Diagram Expert

Single-source skill for architecture documentation and technical visualization. Covers C4 model diagrams and all Mermaid diagram types, plus UI/UX visual design guidance.

## When to Use

- Documenting system architecture or component structure
- Visualizing feature flows or API sequences
- Creating ERDs or data model diagrams
- Planning sprints or release timelines with Gantt charts
- Adding diagrams to PRs or technical documentation
- Onboarding new developers with architecture explanations
- Designing or reviewing UI/UX, accessibility, responsive layouts, or design systems

## Prerequisites

- Mermaid CLI or a Markdown renderer that supports Mermaid (GitHub, GitLab, Cursor, VS Code with Mermaid extension)
- For C4 diagrams: a renderer that supports `C4Context`, `C4Container`, `C4Component`, `C4Deployment`, and `C4Dynamic` diagram types (Mermaid v10+ or Structurizr)
- Windows host is primary. Use PowerShell for all file operations.

## Procedure

### 1. Select the Diagram Type

#### C4 Model — Architecture Documentation

| Level | Type | Audience | Shows |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | `C4Context` | Everyone | System + external actors |
| 2 | `C4Container` | Technical team | Apps, DBs, services |
| 3 | `C4Component` | Developers | Internal components |
| 4 | `C4Deployment` | DevOps | Infrastructure nodes |
| — | `C4Dynamic` | Technical team | Numbered request flows |

**Rule**: Context + Container diagrams are sufficient for most teams. Only create Component/Code diagrams when they add real value.

#### Mermaid — General Visualization

| Situation | Diagram Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| Step-by-step process, decision tree | `graph` (flowchart) |
| API interactions, inter-service calls | `sequenceDiagram` |
| Data model, relationships | `erDiagram` |
| Object hierarchy | `classDiagram` |
| State machine, lifecycle | `stateDiagram-v2` |
| Sprint/release plan | `gantt` |
| Proportions, ratios | `pie` |
| User journey | `journey` |
| Git branch strategy | `gitGraph` |

### 2. Create C4 Diagrams

#### System Context (Level 1)

```mermaid
C4Context
  title System Context — Modern Web Platform

  Person(user, "User", "End user of the system")
  Person(admin, "Admin", "Manages users and system")

  System(system, "Software System", "Main application platform")

  System_Ext(auth, "Auth Provider", "Authentication service")
  System_Ext(db, "Database", "Data storage service")
  System_Ext(ai, "AI Provider", "AI models")
  System_Ext(email, "Email Service", "Notification delivery")

  Rel(user, system, "Uses", "HTTPS")
  Rel(admin, system, "Manages", "HTTPS")
  Rel(system, auth, "Auth check", "OAuth/SDK")
  Rel(system, db, "Reads/Writes", "SDK/SQL")
  Rel(system, ai, "AI completion", "REST API")
  Rel(system, email, "Sends email", "REST API")
```

#### Container (Level 2)

```mermaid
C4Container
  title Container Diagram — Modern Web Platform

  Person(user, "User", "End user")
  Person(admin, "Admin", "System manager")

  Container_Boundary(platform, "Software System") {
    Container(webApp, "Web App", "React/TypeScript", "User-facing SPA")
    Container(apiGateway, "API Gateway", "Node.js/Express", "Request routing and auth")
    Container(worker, "Background Worker", "Node.js/BullMQ", "Async job processing")
    ContainerDb(appDb, "Application DB", "PostgreSQL", "Primary data store")
    Container(cache, "Cache", "Redis", "Session and rate-limit cache")
  }

  System_Ext(auth, "Auth Provider", "OAuth2 identity")
  System_Ext(ai, "AI Provider", "LLM API")
  System_Ext(email, "Email Service", "Transactional email")

  Rel(user, webApp, "Uses", "HTTPS")
  Rel(admin, webApp, "Manages via", "HTTPS")
  Rel(webApp, apiGateway, "Calls", "REST/HTTPS")
  Rel(apiGateway, auth, "Validates token", "OAuth2")
  Rel(apiGateway, appDb, "Reads/Writes", "SQL/TLS")
  Rel(apiGateway, cache, "Reads/Writes", "Redis protocol")
  Rel(apiGateway, worker, "Enqueues jobs", "BullMQ")
  Rel(worker, ai, "Requests completion", "REST API")
  Rel(worker, email, "Sends notifications", "REST API")
```

#### Component (Level 3) — Only When It Adds Value

```mermaid
C4Component
  title Component Diagram — API Gateway

  Container_Boundary(apiGateway, "API Gateway") {
    Component(authMiddleware, "Auth Middleware", "Express middleware", "JWT validation")
    Component(rateLimiter, "Rate Limiter", "Express middleware", "Request throttling")
    Component(router, "Route Handler", "Express router", "Endpoint dispatch")
    Component(controller, "Business Controller", "TypeScript class", "Domain logic")
    Component(repo, "Repository", "TypeScript class", "Data access layer")
  }

  Rel(authMiddleware, rateLimiter, "Passes request", "in-process")
  Rel(rateLimiter, router, "Passes request", "in-process")
  Rel(router, controller, "Invokes", "in-process")
  Rel(controller, repo, "Calls", "in-process")
```

#### Deployment (Level 4)

```mermaid
C4Deployment
  title Deployment Diagram — Production

  Deployment_Node(prod, "Production", "AWS") {
    Deployment_Node(vpc, "VPC", "Virtual network") {
      Deployment_Node(alb, "ALB", "Application Load Balancer") {
        Container(webApp, "Web App", "React/TypeScript", "SPA")
      }
      Deployment_Node(ecsCluster, "ECS Cluster", "Fargate") {
        Container(apiGateway, "API Gateway", "Node.js", "API service")
        Container(worker, "Worker", "Node.js", "Job processor")
      }
      Deployment_Node(rds, "RDS", "Managed DB") {
        ContainerDb(appDb, "Application DB", "PostgreSQL", "Primary store")
      }
    }
  }

  Rel(alb, apiGateway, "Routes to", "HTTPS")
  Rel(apiGateway, appDb, "Reads/Writes", "SQL/TLS")
  Rel(apiGateway, worker, "Enqueues", "BullMQ")
```

#### Dynamic (Request Flow)

```mermaid
C4Dynamic
  title Dynamic Diagram — User Login Flow

  Container(webApp, "Web App", "React")
  Container(apiGateway, "API Gateway", "Node.js")
  System_Ext(auth, "Auth Provider", "OAuth2")
  ContainerDb(appDb, "Application DB", "PostgreSQL")

  Rel(webApp, apiGateway, "1. POST /login", "HTTPS")
  Rel(apiGateway, auth, "2. Validate credentials", "OAuth2")
  Rel(auth, apiGateway, "3. Return JWT", "JSON")
  Rel(apiGateway, appDb, "4. Load user profile", "SQL")
  Rel(appDb, apiGateway, "5. Return profile", "SQL")
  Rel(apiGateway, webApp, "6. Return session", "JSON")
```

### 3. Create Mermaid Diagrams

#### Flowchart

```mermaid
graph TD
  A[User Request] --> B{Authenticated?}
  B -- Yes --> C[Process Request]
  B -- No --> D[Redirect to Login]
  D --> E[Login Form]
  E --> F{Valid Credentials?}
  F -- Yes --> C
  F -- No --> E
  C --> G[Return Response]
```

#### Sequence Diagram

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant W as Web App
  participant A as API Gateway
  participant D as Database

  U->>W: Click "Submit"
  W->>A: POST /api/data
  A->>D: SELECT * FROM records
  D-->>A: Return rows
  A-->>W: 200 OK + JSON
  W-->>U: Display results
```

#### ERD

```mermaid
erDiagram
  USER ||--o{ ORDER : places
  ORDER ||--|{ LINE_ITEM : contains
  PRODUCT ||--o{ LINE_ITEM : "ordered in"

  USER {
    bigint id PK
    string email
    string name
    timestamp created_at
  }
  ORDER {
    bigint id PK
    bigint user_id FK
    string status
    timestamp created_at
  }
  LINE_ITEM {
    bigint id PK
    bigint order_id FK
    bigint product_id FK
    int quantity
  }
  PRODUCT {
    bigint id PK
    string name
    decimal price
  }
```

#### State Diagram

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> Pending
  Pending --> Processing: Start
  Processing --> Completed: Success
  Processing --> Failed: Error
  Failed --> Pending: Retry
  Completed --> [*]
  Failed --> [*]: Max retries
```

#### Gantt Chart

```mermaid
gantt
  title Sprint 12 — Q3 2026
  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD
  axisFormat %b %d

  section Backend
  API Design       :b1, 2026-07-01, 3d
  Implementation   :b2, after b1, 5d
  Testing          :b3, after b2, 3d

  section Frontend

  section DevOps
  CI Pipeline      :d1, 2026-07-03, 2d
  Deploy Prep      :d2, after b3, 2d
```

#### Git Graph

```mermaid
gitGraph
  commit id: "init"
  commit id: "setup"
  branch develop
  checkout develop
  commit id: "feature-1"
  commit id: "feature-2"
  checkout main
  merge develop id: "release-1"
  commit id: "hotfix"
```

### 4. Write Diagrams to Output Locations

Use this directory structure for architecture documentation:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "docs\architecture"
```

```
docs/architecture/
  c4-context.md              # System context diagram
  c4-containers.md           # Container diagram
  c4-deployment.md           # Deployment diagram
  c4-dynamic-{flow}.md       # Specific flow diagrams
  c4-components-{feature}.md # Feature-based component diagrams
```

Write each diagram to its own file:

```powershell
# Example: write context diagram
Set-Content -Path "docs\architecture\c4-context.md" -Encoding UTF8 -Value @"
# System Context

```mermaid
C4Context
  title System Context — Modern Web Platform
  ...
```
"@
```

### 5. Apply C4 Best Practices

1. **Each element**: Name + Type + Technology + Description (short, max 50 characters).
2. **Unidirectional arrows only**: Bidirectional arrows create ambiguity.
3. **Arrow labels start with action verbs**: "Reads", "Writes", "Sends", "Validates".
4. **Add technology labels**: "JSON/HTTPS", "SDK", "SQL/TLS".
5. **Max 20 elements per diagram**: Split into multiple diagrams if exceeded.
6. **One diagram per file**: Keeps documentation navigable and diff-friendly.

### 6. Apply UI/UX Visual Design Guidance (2026)

When the task involves visual design, UI review, or frontend implementation:

1. **Define audience and constraints**: target users, primary task, platform, viewport range, existing design system, accessibility requirements, brand constraints, data density, interaction states, success metric.
2. **Start from user task and information architecture**, not decoration.
3. **Map key states**: empty, loading, success, error, disabled, permission-limited, offline, and responsive variants.
4. **Apply accessibility early**: keyboard flow, focus visibility, labels, contrast, reduced motion, touch targets, text resizing, semantic structure.
5. **Use design-system primitives** where available; otherwise define tokens for spacing, color, type, elevation, radius, and motion.
6. **Design responsive layouts** with stable dimensions and no text overlap across desktop and mobile.
7. **Validate with realistic content**: long labels, error text, touch/keyboard interaction.
8. **Deliver concrete implementation guidance**, not vague aesthetic notes.

**Output format for UI/UX tasks**: user goal, layout structure, component list, states, accessibility checks, responsive behavior, copy notes, and verification steps. For code tasks, include exact files/components and testing guidance.

## Pitfalls

- **Do not write comment lines in code or configuration files.** This is a hard rule — diagrams go in Markdown files, not as inline comments in source code.
- **Do not create Component/Code diagrams by default.** They add maintenance burden. Only create them when they provide real value to the team.
- **Bidirectional arrows in C4 diagrams** create ambiguity about which system initiates the interaction. Always use unidirectional arrows.
- **Overloaded diagrams** (more than 20 elements) become unreadable. Split into multiple focused diagrams.
- **Missing technology labels** on relationships make diagrams vague. Always specify protocol/format: "HTTPS", "SQL/TLS", "REST API".
- **Vague arrow labels** like "interacts with" or "connects to" carry no information. Use action verbs: "Reads", "Writes", "Sends", "Validates".
- **Multiple diagrams in one file** make navigation and diffing harder. One diagram per file.
- **UI polish over weak structure**: visual decoration cannot fix poor information architecture. Structure first, polish second.
- **Ignoring accessibility**: contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and reduced motion are not optional add-ons.
- **Fragile viewport-scaled text**: do not rely on CSS viewport units for body text; it causes overlap on narrow and wide screens.

## Verification

### Verify Mermaid Syntax

Check that diagram files contain valid Mermaid syntax:

```powershell
# List all architecture diagram files
Get-ChildItem -Path "docs\architecture" -Filter "*.md" | Select-Object Name, Length

# Verify each file starts with a heading and contains a mermaid block
Get-ChildItem -Path "docs\architecture" -Filter "*.md" | ForEach-Object {
  $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
  $hasHeading = $content -match '^#\s'
  $hasMermaid = $content -match '```mermaid'
  Write-Output "$($_.Name): heading=$hasHeading mermaid=$hasMermaid"
}
```

### Verify C4 Element Count

```powershell
# Check that no C4 diagram exceeds 20 elements
Get-ChildItem -Path "docs\architecture" -Filter "c4-*.md" | ForEach-Object {
  $content = Get-Content $_.FullName -Raw
  $elementCount = ([regex]::Matches($content, '(?m)^(Person|System|System_Ext|Container|ContainerDb|Component|Deployment_Node)\b')).Count
  Write-Output "$($_.Name): elements=$elementCount $(if($elementCount -gt 20){'WARN: exceeds 20'}else{'OK'})"
}
```

### Verify Output Directory Structure

```powershell
# Confirm architecture docs directory exists and has content
Test-Path "docs\architecture"
(Get-ChildItem "docs\architecture" -Filter "*.md").Count
```

Expected output: `True` and a file count greater than 0.

### Verify UI/UX Quality Checklist

- [ ] User can complete the core task quickly and repeatedly.
- [ ] UI supports keyboard, screen readers, visible focus, and sufficient contrast.
- [ ] Mobile and desktop layouts do not overlap or rely on fragile viewport-scaled text.
- [ ] Controls use familiar affordances and expose state clearly.
- [ ] Motion is purposeful and respects reduced-motion preferences.
- [ ] Visual direction is intentional and consistent with the product domain.
- [ ] Diagrams have boundaries, labels, legends, and update ownership.
