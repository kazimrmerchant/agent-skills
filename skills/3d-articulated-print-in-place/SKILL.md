# Articulated Print-in-Place Design & Engineering Guide

Complete workflow for designing, calibrating, and printing articulated print-in-place (PiP) mechanisms on FDM printers, focused on the Bambu Lab P1S. Includes tolerance engineering tables, mechanism taxonomies, failure diagnostics, and parametric code in OpenSCAD and Python.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when the user needs to:

- Design or generate articulated print-in-place 3D models (dragons, snakes, octopi, fidget toys, chains, gears).
- Engineer clearances and tolerances for PiP mechanisms on FDM printers.
- Calibrate a Bambu Lab P1S (or similar CoreXY) for PiP printing.
- Diagnose PiP failures (fused joints, broken joints, grinding motion, first-layer fusion).
- Generate parametric ball-and-socket chains via OpenSCAD or Python.
- Work with TPU living hinges or flexible compliant mechanisms.

**Trigger keywords:** print-in-place, PiP, articulated, flexi, ball-and-socket, living hinge, knuckle hinge, tolerance test, clearance gap, Bambu P1S, fidget toy, chain mail.

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware

- Bambu Lab P1S (enclosed CoreXY, direct drive, automatic bed leveling) or equivalent FDM printer.
- 0.4 mm nozzle (hardened steel or stainless steel) — all tolerance tables assume this.
- Textured PEI build plate.

### Software

- **Bambu Studio** slicer (for P1S profile and precision settings).
- **OpenSCAD** (for parametric model generation): install from openscad.org.
- **Python 3.10+** with `numpy` and `numpy-stl` for the Python STL generator.

```powershell
python -m pip install numpy numpy-stl
```

### Filament

- PLA (recommended default for PiP), PETG (use with caution), or TPU 95A (advanced).
- Filament must be dried before printing (see Procedure step 3).

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Identify the Mechanism Type

Select the mechanism based on the required motion:

| Mechanism | Motion | Key Design Rules |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Ball-and-socket** | Multi-axis rotation | Ball ≥ 8 mm; socket opening = 65–75% of ball dia; clearance 0.3 mm/side (PLA); socket wall ≥ 1.5 mm; print socket opening upward. |
| **Pin hinge (knuckle)** | Single-axis rotation | Pin dia 3–5 mm (small) / 6–10 mm (structural); radial clearance 0.2–0.3 mm; odd knuckle count (3 or 5); chamfer knuckle ends 45°; print hinge axis vertical. |
| **Gears** | Rotational meshing | Module ≥ 1.0 mm; backlash 0.3–0.5 mm total; ≥ 12 teeth; pressure angle 20°; axle clearance 0.3 mm radial; print flat, gear axis vertical. |
| **Chain links** | Articulated chain | Wire dia 2–4 mm; inner clearance 0.4–0.6 mm; aspect ratio 2:1; chamfer all inner edges; minimum 3 links for test. |
| **Flexi / accordion** | Continuous flex | Wall 0.8–1.2 mm (2–3 lines); fold angle 30–60°; fold pitch 2–4 mm; PLA for rigidity or TPU for extreme flex. |

### Step 2 — Determine Clearances from the Tolerance Table

All values are **per-side clearances** (total gap is double). Assumes 0.4 mm nozzle, 0.2 mm layer height.

| Fit Type | PLA (mm) | PETG (mm) | TPU 95A (mm) | Application |
|----------|----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| Press Fit | 0.00–0.10 | 0.05–0.15 | 0.00–0.05 | Permanent snap-fit caps |
| Snug Fit | 0.10–0.20 | 0.15–0.25 | 0.05–0.15 | Removable caps, tight pivots |
| Sliding Fit | 0.20–0.30 | 0.25–0.35 | 0.15–0.25 | Drawer slides, pistons |
| Loose / Hinge | 0.30–0.40 | 0.35–0.50 | 0.25–0.35 | Hinges, articulated toys |
| Free Rotation | 0.40–0.60 | 0.50–0.70 | 0.30–0.50 | Bearings, wheels, ball joints |

**Orientation impacts:**
- **XY plane (horizontal):** Best accuracy (±0.1 mm). Circles become polygons — add 0.1–0.2 mm compensation.
- **Z axis (vertical):** Limited by layer height. Stair-stepping reduces effective clearance. Overhangs > 45° sag and close gaps.
- **First layer (elephant's foot):** Lateral expansion 0.1–0.3 mm. Add 0.5 mm chamfer on all bottom edges. Use slicer Elephant Foot Compensation.

**Hole compensation (add to diameter):**

| Hole Diameter | Add to Diameter |
|---------------|-----------------|
| < 5 mm | +0.3 mm |
| 5–15 mm | +0.2 mm |
| > 15 mm | +0.1 mm |

### Step 3 — Dry Filament and Calibrate the P1S

1. **Dry filament:**
   - PLA: 45°C for 4–6 hours.
   - PETG: 65°C for 6–8 hours.
   - TPU: 50°C for 10–12 hours.
   - Use the P1S heatbed or an external dryer.

2. **Run auto-calibration** on the P1S: vibration compensation, flow dynamics, flow rate — for each filament spool.

3. **First layer calibration:** Print the built-in first-layer test pattern. First layer should be smooth and flat — no gaps, no excessive squish.

4. **Clean build plate:** Wash textured PEI with dish soap and warm water. Wipe with isopropyl alcohol (90%+) between prints.

5. **Check nozzle:** Inspect for wear. A worn nozzle produces inconsistent extrusion that ruins tight tolerances.

### Step 4 — Print a Tolerance Test Coupon

Before printing any PiP model:

1. Download a tolerance test from MakerWorld or Printables (search "print in place tolerance test").
2. Print with the same filament, profile, and settings planned for the final model.
3. Try to free each test gap starting from the largest.
4. Record the smallest gap that separates cleanly — this is the printer's minimum clearance for that material/profile.
5. **Design all PiP gaps to be at least 0.05 mm larger than this minimum.**

### Step 5 — Configure Bambu Studio Slicer Settings for PiP

**Quality Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Layer Height | 0.16–0.20 mm | 0.16 for fine joints, 0.20 for speed |
| First Layer Height | 0.20 mm | Standard adhesion |
| Line Width | 0.42 mm | Slight over-width for adhesion |
| Wall Loops | 3 | Strength + detail balance |
| Top/Bottom Layers | 4 | Solid caps |
| Infill | 15–20% Gyroid | Strength-to-weight ratio |

**Precision Settings (Quality > Precision in Bambu Studio):**

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| X-Y Hole Compensation | 0.05–0.10 mm | Enlarges holes for shrink |
| X-Y Contour Compensation | -0.02 to -0.05 mm | Shrinks outer walls for clearance |
| Elephant Foot Compensation | 0.10–0.15 mm | Prevents first-layer fusion |

**Speed Settings:**

| Setting | Value | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Outer Wall Speed | 100–150 mm/s | Slower for accuracy |
| Inner Wall Speed | 150–200 mm/s | Faster than outer |
| Infill Speed | 200–250 mm/s | Speed fine for infill |
| First Layer Speed | 50 mm/s | Critical for adhesion + accuracy |
| Travel Speed | 300–400 mm/s | Fast travel, use Z-hop |

**Other Critical Settings:**
- **Z-Hop:** Enable at 0.4 mm — prevents nozzle from dragging across printed parts.
- **Seam Position:** "Aligned" or "Back" — keep seam blobs away from joints.
- **Wall Order:** Inner/Outer/Inner ("Sandwich") — best dimensional accuracy.
- **Supports:** **NONE.** PiP models must print without supports.
- **Brim:** Avoid if possible. If needed, use narrow brim (3 mm) and exclude from joint areas.

### Step 6 — Set Material-Specific P1S Profile

**PLA (recommended for PiP):**
- Nozzle: 210–220°C
- Bed: 55–60°C (textured PEI)
- Fan: 80–100% after first layer
- Flow ratio: calibrate per spool (typical 0.95–0.98)

**PETG (use with caution for PiP):**
- Nozzle: 240–250°C
- Bed: 70–80°C
- Fan: 30–60%
- Flow ratio: calibrate (typical 0.93–0.97)
- Add 0.1 mm extra clearance vs PLA values
- Higher stringing risk — tune retraction carefully

**TPU 95A (advanced users):**
- Nozzle: 220–235°C
- Bed: 50–60°C
- Fan: 50–70%
- Speed: max 40 mm/s outer wall, 60 mm/s inner wall
- Direct drive only (P1S is direct drive — fine)
- Reduce retraction to 0.5–1.0 mm

### Step 7 — Generate the Model (If Using Parametric Scripts)

**Option A — OpenSCAD:**

1. Load `scripts/articulated_chain.scad`.
2. Adjust parameters at the top of the file:

```openscad
segment_count    = 6;      // Number of segments
ball_diameter    = 8;      // Ball diameter (mm)
clearance        = 0.3;    // Per-side clearance (mm)
socket_wall      = 1.6;    // Socket wall thickness (mm)
socket_opening   = 0.70;   // Opening as fraction of ball dia (0.6–0.8)
segment_length   = 18;     // Segment length (mm)
segment_width    = 12;     // Segment width (mm)
segment_height   = 10;     // Segment height (mm)
connector_diam   = 5;      // Connector rod diameter (mm)
chamfer_size     = 0.5;    // Bottom chamfer (mm)
fn_resolution    = 48;     // Facet count
```

3. Render (F6) and export STL (F7).
4. Open the STL in Bambu Studio and apply PiP settings from Step 5.

**Option B — Python:**

```powershell
python scripts\articulated_chain.py
```

1. Adjust parameters at the top of `scripts/articulated_chain.py` (same names as OpenSCAD).
2. Run the script — outputs `articulated_chain.stl`.
3. Open in Bambu Studio and apply PiP settings.

### Step 8 — Print and Free the Joints

1. Slice in Bambu Studio with PiP settings. Confirm supports are OFF.
2. Print on the P1S.
3. After printing, free joints by:
   - Scoring the joint line with a hobby knife before applying force.
   - Twisting gently — do not pull straight.
   - Working the joint back and forth 20–30 times to smooth surfaces.

### Step 9 — Apply TPU Living Hinge Rules (If Using TPU)

**Critical dimensions:**
- Hinge thickness: 0.4–0.6 mm (1–2 perimeter widths with 0.4 mm nozzle).
- Hinge length (along bend axis): ≥ 3× thickness for stress distribution.
- Transition radius: 1–2 mm fillet from hinge web to rigid body.
- Bend radius: minimum 2× hinge thickness.

**Layer orientation rule (HARD):**
- Layers MUST run parallel to the bend axis.
- If layers are perpendicular to the bend, the hinge delaminates on the first cycle.
- Print the hinge web in the XY plane with the bend axis aligned to X or Y.

**TPU print settings for mechanisms:**

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---------|-------|-----------|
| Print Speed | 20–40 mm/s | Prevents filament buckling |
| Retraction Distance | 0–2 mm | Excess retraction causes jams |
| Retraction Speed | 20–25 mm/s | Gentle, prevents stretching |
| Temperature | 220–235°C (95A TPU) | Per manufacturer |
| Bed Temperature | 50–60°C | Good adhesion, no warping |
| Cooling Fan | 50–80% | Solidify without over-cooling |
| Infill (hinge area) | 100% | Voids cause crack initiation |
| Infill (body) | 15–25% | Save material |
| Wall Count | 3–4 | Structural integrity |

**TPU PiP clearances:**
- Reduce clearances by 0.05–0.10 mm compared to PLA (flexibility compensates).
- Apply light dusting of talcum powder or PTFE spray to mating surfaces after printing.
- Dry filament before printing: 50–55°C for 10–12 hours.

## Pitfalls

### Joints Fused Solid

Parts do not move at all after printing.

1. **Over-extrusion** — Calibrate flow rate. Reduce by 2–5% and retest.
2. **Insufficient clearance** — Increase gap by 0.05–0.1 mm in CAD.
3. **Nozzle too close (Z-offset)** — Raise nozzle slightly. First layer should not be transparently thin.
4. **Wet filament** — Dry the filament. Moisture causes foaming and expansion.
5. **Too hot** — Lower nozzle temperature by 5–10°C to reduce ooze.
6. **Slicer fix** — Apply negative X-Y Contour Compensation (-0.05 to -0.15 mm).

### Joints Break When Freed

Parts snap cleanly at the joint when trying to break them free.

1. **Insufficient wall thickness** — Increase socket wall to 1.5–2.0 mm minimum.
2. **Layer line weakness** — Reorient model so bending forces do not pull layers apart.
3. **Brittle filament** — Switch to PLA+ or PETG for better inter-layer adhesion.
4. **Forcing fused joints** — Score joint line with hobby knife first. Twist gently, do not pull.
5. **Too much clearance** — Excess clearance makes thin joint walls that snap. Find the balance.

### Rough or Grinding Motion

Joints move but feel gritty, scratchy, or require significant force.

1. **Stair-stepping** — Reduce layer height to 0.12–0.16 mm for smoother curves.
2. **Stringing inside joints** — Tune retraction and enable "Wipe" moves.
3. **Debris in joint** — Work the joint back and forth 20–30 times to smooth surfaces.
4. **Elephant's foot** — Enable elephant foot compensation (0.1–0.2 mm).
5. **Seam inside joint** — Move seam position to avoid joint surfaces.

### Mechanism Locks in One Position

Joint moves partially but locks or catches at certain angles.

1. **Z-seam blob** — Relocate seam away from joint area.
2. **Over-extrusion on specific layers** — Check for partial clogs or inconsistent filament diameter.
3. **Overhang sag** — Underside of bridging surfaces droops into gap. Add 45° chamfers on overhanging joint edges.
4. **Thermal warping** — Ensure enclosure temperature is stable. Open the P1S door slightly for PLA to prevent heat creep.

### First Layer Fusion

Base of the mechanism is fused to itself or to bed features.

1. **Z-offset too low** — Raise Z by 0.02–0.05 mm increments.
2. **No chamfer on base** — Add 0.5 mm 45° chamfer on all bottom edges.
3. **Brim interference** — Do not use brim on PiP models, or manually exclude brim from joint region.
4. **Elephant foot compensation** — Enable in slicer at 0.1–0.15 mm.

### TPU Living Hinge Delamination

Hinge cracks on first bend cycle.

- **Cause:** Layers are perpendicular to the bend axis.
- **Fix:** Reorient so layers run parallel to the bend axis. Hinge web must be in the XY plane with bend axis aligned to X or Y.

## Verification

### Pre-Print Checklist

Confirm all of the following before slicing:

```
[ ] Filament dried (PLA 45°C/4-6h, PETG 65°C/6-8h, TPU 50°C/10-12h)
[ ] Flow rate calibrated for this spool
[ ] Tolerance test printed and minimum gap recorded
[ ] Model clearance >= minimum gap + 0.05 mm
[ ] Supports DISABLED
[ ] Z-hop ENABLED (0.4 mm)
[ ] Seam position away from joints (Aligned or Back)
[ ] Elephant foot compensation ON (0.10-0.15 mm)
[ ] X-Y contour compensation set (-0.02 to -0.05 mm)
[ ] First layer calibration verified (not too squished)
[ ] Wall order: Inner/Outer/Inner (Sandwich)
```

### Post-Print Verification

1. **Joint freedom:** Every joint should move after gentle freeing. Score with hobby knife, twist gently.
2. **Motion smoothness:** Work each joint through 20–30 cycles. Grinding should diminish. If it persists, check for stringing or seam blobs inside joints.
3. **No delamination:** Inspect socket walls and hinge webs for cracks. If present, increase wall thickness or reorient print.
4. **First layer integrity:** Confirm the base is not fused. If fused, raise Z-offset 0.02–0.05 mm and add 0.5 mm chamfer.

### Python Script Output Verification

```powershell
python scripts\articulated_chain.py
```

Expected output:
```
Generating articulated chain with 6 segments...
  Ball radius:  4.0 mm
  Clearance:    0.3 mm per side
  Socket wall:  1.6 mm
  Body length:  18.0 mm
  Body radius:  6.0 mm
Saved N triangles to articulated_chain.stl
Output: articulated_chain.stl
Open in your slicer and print with PiP settings from the skill guide.
```

Verify the STL file exists:

```powershell
Test-Path articulated_chain.stl
```

Expected: `True`

## Quick-Reference Cheat Sheet

### Clearance Decision Matrix

```
Is the joint rigid or moving?
├─ Rigid (snap-fit, press-fit)      → 0.00–0.15 mm
└─ Moving
   ├─ Sliding only (piston, drawer) → 0.20–0.30 mm
   ├─ Rotating (hinge, pin)         → 0.30–0.40 mm
   ├─ Multi-axis (ball joint)       → 0.35–0.50 mm
   └─ Free spin (bearing, wheel)    → 0.40–0.60 mm
```

### Material Selection for PiP

```
Need rigidity + clean joints?  → PLA (best default)
Need toughness + flexibility?  → PLA+ or PETG (+0.1 mm clearance)
Need rubber-like flex?          → TPU 95A (-0.05 mm clearance)
Need high temp resistance?      → PETG or ABS (requires enclosure)
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Multi-Material PiP (P1S + AMS)

- Print body in rigid PLA and joints in flexible TPU using AMS.
- Use slicer "paint on" material assignment to designate regions.
- TPU joint acts as built-in damper for smooth, quiet articulation.
- Clearance at PLA-TPU interface: 0.1–0.2 mm (TPU flex compensates).

### Captive Fastener Technique

- Print ball-and-socket with 0.5 mm clearance (intentionally loose).
- Design a captive screw hole through the socket wall.
- After printing, insert an M3 set screw to adjustably tighten the joint.

### Nested Bearing Races

- Design two concentric rings with a channel between them.
- Place captive balls (printed in place) in the channel.
- Ball diameter: 3–4 mm, channel clearance: 0.3 mm around each ball.
- Creates a functional thrust bearing printed as one piece.

### Compliant Mechanisms

- Design thin flexure beams (0.6–1.0 mm thick) that bend elastically.
- Arrange multiple flexures in parallel for guided linear motion.
- Use cross-flexure pivots for rotational compliance without backlash.
- Best in TPU or Nylon; PLA works for low-cycle applications.
