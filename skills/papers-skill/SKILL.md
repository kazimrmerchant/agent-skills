# Papers Skill

## Overview

Papers Skill turns a coding agent into a literature-research assistant. It orchestrates a bundled Python CLI (`scripts/papers.py`) that hits the free Semantic Scholar and arXiv APIs, downloads arXiv PDFs, and extracts text with PyMuPDF. The agent decides which subcommand to invoke and how to combine results into a literature scan, a deep read of one paper, an impact analysis, or a reading list.

This skill is the Skill-mode port of the [papers-mcp](https://github.com/xwmxcz/papers-mcp) MCP server by the same author. Both projects share the same feature set; this one ships as a plugin so it can be installed with a single command and needs no long-running MCP process.

## When to Use

- Use when the user asks to **search academic papers** by topic, author, or venue.
- Use when the user names a **specific paper** (by DOI, arXiv ID, or title) and wants metadata, the abstract, the TL;DR, or its reference list.
- Use when the user wants to find work that **cites** a known paper (impact analysis, follow-up tracking).
- Use when the user wants to **download an arXiv PDF** and have it summarized.
- Use when the user asks to **build a reading list** around a topic.

**Do NOT use this skill when:**

- The user wants paywalled non-arXiv full text. This skill cannot bypass publisher paywalls; it can only fetch arXiv PDFs and metadata everywhere.
- The user wants OCR over scanned PDFs. PyMuPDF extracts embedded text only; scanned image-PDFs return the fallback message and need a separate OCR step.
- The user wants real-time citation alerts or RSS-style watching. This skill is request-driven.

## Prerequisites

Three Python packages are required: `httpx`, `arxiv`, and `PyMuPDF`. Check once per session using the **same interpreter** for both the import-check and the install so targets stay in sync.

**Windows (PowerShell, primary):**

```powershell
python -c "import httpx, arxiv, fitz" 2>&1
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { python -m pip install httpx arxiv PyMuPDF }
```

If `python` is not on PATH, fall back to `py` (Windows launcher) or the absolute interpreter path — and invoke pip via the same interpreter:

```powershell
py -c "import httpx, arxiv, fitz" 2>&1
if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { py -m pip install httpx arxiv PyMuPDF }
```

**macOS / Linux (bash):**

```bash
python -c "import httpx, arxiv, fitz" 2>&1 || python -m pip install httpx arxiv PyMuPDF
```

No API keys or credentials are needed. The CLI performs outbound HTTPS only to `api.semanticscholar.org` and `arxiv.org`. No authentication tokens are sent.

## Procedure

### Step 1 — Locate the bundled CLI

The script lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py` and is bundled with this skill (no separate install needed). Always quote the path so it survives spaces.

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" <subcommand> [args]
```

**macOS / Linux (bash):**

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" <subcommand> [args]
```

### Step 2 — Pick the right subcommand

| Subcommand | Purpose | Max results | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `search <query> [--limit N]` | Semantic Scholar keyword search | 20 | `search "diffusion models" --limit 5` |
| `detail <paper_id>` | Full metadata, TL;DR, top references | — | `detail 10.48550/arXiv.2310.06825` |
| `citations <paper_id> [--limit N]` | Papers citing this one | 20 | `citations <id> --limit 15` |
| `arxiv <query> [--max-results N]` | arXiv preprint search | 10 | `arxiv "RLHF" --max-results 5` |
| `download <arxiv_id> [--save-dir D]` | Save PDF locally | — | `download 2310.06825 --save-dir ./pdfs` |
| `read <pdf_path> [--max-pages N]` | Extract PDF text via PyMuPDF | — | `read ./pdfs/foo.pdf --max-pages 20` |

**ID auto-detection rules** (for `detail` and `citations`):

- DOIs starting with `10.` → used as-is (e.g. `10.48550/arXiv.2310.06825`)
- Bare numeric IDs of 10+ digits → treated as arXiv IDs
- Long hex strings → treated as Semantic Scholar `paperId`s

### Step 3 — Execute the workflow

#### Workflow A: Literature scan on a topic

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" search "retrieval augmented generation" --limit 10
```

Present results as a ranked table: **# | Title | Year | Citations | ID**, then ask the user which papers to dig into.

#### Workflow B: Deep-read one paper

```powershell
# 1. Confirm match — ALWAYS call detail before download
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" detail 2005.11401

# 2. Download the PDF
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" download 2005.11401 --save-dir ./pdfs

# 3. Extract abstract + intro + conclusion
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" read ./pdfs/2005.11401v4.RAG.pdf --max-pages 10
```

Summarize as: **problem · method · key result · limitations**.

#### Workflow C: Impact analysis on an anchor paper

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" detail 10.48550/arXiv.2005.11401
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" citations 10.48550/arXiv.2005.11401 --limit 20
```

Cluster the citing papers by year/theme and highlight the most-cited follow-ups.

### Step 4 — Format output

- Always include the paper ID alongside every title so the user can re-query precisely.
- Cite as `[FirstAuthor et al., Year] *Title* (cites: N)`.
- For PDFs you download, always report the absolute save path.
- Confirm the save path with the user before downloading to an unexpected location.

### Hard rules

- ✅ **Always call `detail` before `download`** to confirm the paper matches user intent. Skipping this leads to wrong PDFs being fetched.
- ❌ **Don't crawl.** The script auto-retries 429s with exponential backoff (3×); don't pile on parallel queries.
- ❌ **Don't raise `--max-pages` to 100+** without warning the user — it can consume a large amount of context.
- `read` opens a local PDF file with PyMuPDF — make sure the path the user supplies is one they trust.
- `download` writes a PDF to the directory the user specifies (default: current working directory).

## Examples

### Example: Build a reading list on "RLHF"

```powershell
# 1. Search Semantic Scholar for breadth
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" search "reinforcement learning from human feedback" --limit 10

# 2. Cross-check arXiv for recent preprints
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" arxiv "RLHF" --max-results 5

# 3. For each top hit, pull detail + citations
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" detail 2204.05862
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" citations 2204.05862 --limit 10
```

Present a curated list grouped by sub-topic with citation counts and one-line summaries.

## Pitfalls

1. **Missing optional dependency message.** The script returns `需要安装 arxiv: pip install arxiv` or `需要安装 PyMuPDF: pip install PyMuPDF` instead of crashing when an optional dependency is missing. Offer to run the install command: `python -m pip install arxiv PyMuPDF`.

2. **Semantic Scholar rate limiting.** `搜索失败: rate limit, retries exhausted` from `search`, `detail`, or `citations`. Semantic Scholar's anonymous tier rate-limits aggressively; the script retries 3× with exponential backoff. **Fix:** Wait ~10 seconds and retry once. For repeated runs, fall back to the `arxiv` subcommand for arXiv-indexed work.

3. **Download fails with `找不到 arXiv ID: …`.** The user gave a non-arXiv ID (likely a DOI for a non-arXiv paper). Use `detail` to inspect; only papers with an `externalIds.ArXiv` field can be downloaded.

4. **Scanned PDF returns fallback text.** `PDF无法提取文本（可能是扫描件）` — PyMuPDF extracts embedded text only. Offer the user an alternative version or note that OCR is required (separate tool).

5. **Garbled Chinese output on Windows.** The script already forces UTF-8 stdout. If the host terminal is still misconfigured, set the environment variable before running:

   ```powershell
   $env:PYTHONIOENCODING = "utf-8"
   ```

6. **Paywalled full text.** The skill cannot fetch full text from paywalled publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Wiley, etc.). It can only read open arXiv PDFs. Metadata and abstracts are available everywhere via Semantic Scholar.

## Verification

After running any subcommand, verify the output is valid:

**Check 1 — Search returns results:**

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" search "attention is all you need" --limit 3
```

Expected: JSON or formatted output with at least 1 result containing `title`, `year`, `citationCount`, and `paperId` fields.

**Check 2 — Detail resolves a known paper:**

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" detail 10.48550/arXiv.1706.03762
```

Expected: Metadata including title "Attention Is All You Need", authors, abstract, TL;DR, and a references list.

**Check 3 — Download + read round-trip:**

```powershell
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" download 1706.03762 --save-dir ./pdfs
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/skills/papers-skill/scripts/papers.py" read ./pdfs/1706.03762v7.pdf --max-pages 5
```

Expected: PDF file written to `./pdfs/`, then extracted text from the first 5 pages printed to stdout.

**Check 4 — Dependencies present:**

```powershell
python -c "import httpx, arxiv, fitz; print('OK')"
```

Expected: `OK` with no error output.
