# Quality ranking

**Date:** 2026-08-14  
**Generation SHA:** this commit (A/A+ YAML when+not-for + ranking refresh). Parent leftover close: `e88b1be`.  
**Inventory:** 487 sibling folders under `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`  
**Structural refresh:** leftover below-A, then A/A+ YAML when+not-for (273 unique descriptions). July `independent_*` columns **unchanged**.

This sheet is **method first**, then ranks. Rate the 12 works-verified chairs before treating a high PQI as a “it works” claim.

## Rate / install first

These **12 WORKS** are ranks **1–12** after the works-first sort (Read sample 2026-08-14). Install and rate this set before treating any high PQI as a works claim.

| rank | skill | tag | pqi | Read sample 2026-08-14 |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | `better` | agent-os | 100.0 | Numbered 0–5 polish loop (`BETTER:` report). |
| 2 | `godot-ui` | godot | 100.0 | Godot 4.3+ Control/Theme/focus GDScript; layout ref present. |
| 3 | `ollama-local-setup` | ai-ml | 98.9 | Numbered Windows Ollama install; `scripts/verify-ollama.ps1` exists. |
| 4 | `stable-diffusion` | ai-ml | 97.8 | Numbered HuggingFace Diffusers pipelines (txt2img, ControlNet, LoRA). |
| 5 | `mcp-server-authoring` | agent-os | 97.2 | Numbered MCP transport/tool-design; inspector + templates. |
| 6 | `chroma` | ai-ml | 96.1 | Numbered chromadb `create_collection` / `add` / `query`. |
| 7 | `git-workflow` | agent-os | 96.1 | Numbered PowerShell git/gh; companions present. |
| 8 | `threejs-fundamentals` | threejs | 96.1 | Numbered scene/camera/renderer/Object3D scaffold. |
| 9 | `weights-and-biases` | ai-ml | 96.1 | Numbered `wandb.init` / `log` / `sweep`; refs present. |
| 10 | `github-actions-advanced` | git-github | 95.2 | PowerShell discovery then SHA-pinned workflow YAML. |
| 11 | `docker-management` | devops | 95.0 | Numbered `docker` / `compose` lifecycle. |
| 12 | `emil-design-eng` | frontend | 94.5 | Numbered animation craft with real CSS/JS APIs. |

### WEAK (ranks 13–16) — caveats, not install-first

Kept in the Read sample with caveats. **Not** an install-first set. Evidence: [INCLUSION.md](INCLUSION.md#works-bar-executability).

| rank | skill | tag | pqi | Caveat |
| --- | --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| 13 | `shadcn` | frontend | 83.2 | CLI procedure is real; companions live at skill root (`cli.md`, `rules/`). |
| 14 | `angular-state-management` | frontend | 82.6 | Snippets miss imports; injects `HttpClient` then uses `fetch`. |
| 15 | `glassmorphism` | frontend | 81.5 | Copy-paste CSS; labels itself a `design-it` child, not a direct trigger. |
| 16 | `energy-procurement` | ai-ml | 80.4 | Domain C&I playbook with real formulas; not a shell procedure. |

## How assessed

Three layers. They are not interchangeable.

1. **Independent (July 2026).** `independent_score` / `independent_grade` / `independent_decision` are the 2026-07-17 `qwen36_27b` re-grade of the **private** library (2,540 skills, mean **69.2**). Joined here by folder name = CSV `skill`. The public tree is mostly the `QUALITY_KEEP` slice of that re-grade, plus v1 chairs. **This wave did not re-score 487 bodies with a model.** A high independent score is a July library grade, not a 2026-08-14 reread.
2. **Structural (today).** `structural_now` is a 2026-08-14 mechanical scan of **this repo’s** `SKILL.md` files (frontmatter length/signals, numbered procedure, claimed `references/` / `scripts/` paths on disk, lean line count, YAML `name` vs folder). No LLM. Thresholds below are falsifiable.
3. **Works overlay (Read sample only).** `works` is **N=18** from 2026-08-14: **12 WORKS**, **4 WEAK**, **2 FAIL** (already cut from git). Everyone else is `untested`. Untested ≠ fail. Untested ≠ works. **Do not claim all 487 are verified-works.**

PQI blends those layers with the formula below. It is **not** “we re-read 487 today.” It is **not** an agy/encyclopedia CLI label. It is **not** a VALUE_FRAMEWORK rescore of this week’s bodies.

### How to read ranks

Rank 1 = highest recommended under the **sort below**. PQI is compared **inside** a works band, not above it.

- **Ranks 1–12** are the Read-sample **WORKS**, sorted by PQI inside that band (then independent_score, then name). This is the install/rate-first set.
- **Ranks 13–16** are the Read-sample **WEAK** (keep with caveats; not install-first).
- **Ranks 17–487** are **untested** — **not an install order**. PQI there is the July independent score plus today’s structural scan only. Untested ≠ fail. Untested ≠ works.

This wave did **not** re-score 487 bodies with a model.

- `WORKS` — Read-sample pass (procedure an agent can execute).
- `WEAK` — Read-sample keep with caveats (see INCLUSION).
- `untested` — not in the N=18 sample. High PQI here is structure and/or the July score.

v1 chairs with **no** CSV row have empty `independent_*` (displayed as —), **not** a stamped `0`.

Untested PQI = 100 means `structural_now` = 100 (no July row), **not** a works claim — those rows now sit **after** the WORKS and WEAK bands.

## VALUE_FRAMEWORK ↔ independent q-map

Document mapping only. This is **not** a new 2026-08-14 reread of 487 files. Independent subscores are the July `q1`–`q7` fields from that private re-grade.

| VALUE_FRAMEWORK | Independent subscore |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| Clarity | q4_trigger |
| Actionability | q3_procedure |
| Completeness | q2_utility |
| Uniqueness | q5_unique |
| Demand | *(no 1:1; leave blank)* |
| Safe-to-publish | q7_publish + q1_truth |
| Maint | q6_fresh |

## Structural scan (falsifiable)

`structural_now` = `description_points` + `procedure_points` + `claimed_paths_points` + `lean_points` + `name_points` (0–100). Current public `SKILL.md` only.

**description_points (0 / 15 / 30)**

- Parse YAML frontmatter `description` (handle `>` folded and `|` and quoted). Char count = stripped unfolded text length.
- when-signal (case-insensitive, in description): `\bwhen\b` OR `use for` OR `trigger`
- not-for-signal (case-insensitive, in description): `not for` OR `do not use` OR `not a ` OR `never ` OR `not /`
- +30 if len ≥ 80 AND when-signal AND not-for-signal
- +15 if description len ≥ 1 but not both length+signals
- +0 if empty/missing description

Signals are **description-only**. A body “When / Do not use” table does not count. After the 2026-08-14 A/A+ YAML wave, **487/487** chairs have both signals in the YAML `description` (live scan). Historical example: `git-workflow` once had when in YAML and not-for only in a body table → `has_when_not_for=no`, description_points = 15. That chair now has both in YAML.

**procedure_points (0 / 30)**

- +30 if SKILL.md has **≥ 3** lines matching (multiline):
  `^\s*(?:\d+[\.\)]\s+\S|\*\*\d+[\.\)]\*\*|\d+\.\s+\S)`
  OR ≥ 3 headings matching `(?im)^#{2,4}\s+(?:\d+[\.\)]|step\s+\d+)`
- else 0

**claimed_paths_points (0 / 20)**

- From SKILL.md, collect unique relative paths matching `(?:references|scripts)/[A-Za-z0-9._/-]+` (strip trailing punctuation/` )`). Ignore http(s) URLs.
- Resolve each against the skill folder. If **any** claimed file/dir is missing → **0**. If none claimed, or all exist → **20**.
- Root-level `reference.md` / `examples.md` (no `references/` prefix) are **not** this check. Vacuous 20 is OK.

This flag is **not** the works overlay. Lean copies often mention companions that were not copied. After the leftover wave, `claimed_paths_ok=no` is **0**. Root-level files such as `cli.md` are outside this regex.

**lean_points (0 / 10)**

- +10 if SKILL.md line count (splitlines) is **40–700 inclusive**, else 0

**name_points (0 / 10)**

- +10 if YAML `name` equals folder name (strip quotes). Else 0.
- This wave: only `transformers.js` misses (YAML `name` is `transformers-js`).

## PQI formula

Round PQI to 1 decimal.

```
independent = my_score if CSV hit else null

works_overlay:
  WORKS = 100
  WEAK = 55
  untested = omitted from this term (do not treat as 50)

If CSV hit AND untested:
  PQI = 0.70 * independent + 0.30 * structural_now
If CSV hit AND WORKS:
  PQI = 0.50 * independent + 0.20 * structural_now + 0.30 * 100
If CSV hit AND WEAK:
  PQI = 0.50 * independent + 0.20 * structural_now + 0.30 * 55
If no CSV (v1 chairs) AND WORKS:
  PQI = 0.40 * structural_now + 0.60 * 100
If no CSV AND WEAK:
  PQI = 0.40 * structural_now + 0.60 * 55
If no CSV AND untested:
  PQI = structural_now
```

**Sort (rank 1 = highest recommended):**

1. works: **WORKS**, then **WEAK**, then **untested**
2. PQI descending
3. independent_score descending (nulls last)
4. skill name A-Z

Tags come from [CATALOG.md](CATALOG.md) section headers `## <tag> (N)` and the first-column skill names — **not** the private CSV `pack` column (polluted). Every public folder has exactly one tag.

## Columns (what they are / are not)

| Column | Is | Is not |
|--------|----|--------|
| `rank` | Sort order under the keys above | A claim the body was re-read this week |
| `skill` | Folder name | |
| `tag` | CATALOG section | CSV `pack` |
| `pqi` | Blend of layers; 1 decimal | A new model score |
| `independent_score` | July `my_score`, or empty | Invented for v1 misses; empty ≠ 0 |
| `independent_grade` | July `my_grade`, or empty | |
| `independent_decision` | July `my_decision`, or empty | A 2026-08-14 keep/drop |
| `works` | Read-sample overlay | Structural `claimed_paths_ok` |
| `skill_md_lines` | `splitlines()` count | Token count |
| `description_chars` | Stripped unfolded YAML description length | Body length |
| `has_when_not_for` | Both description signals | Body tables |
| `has_numbered_procedure` | Procedure rule above | “Looks procedural” |
| `claimed_paths_ok` | All matched `references/` / `scripts/` exist, or none claimed | Root `reference.md` |
| `name_matches_folder` | YAML `name` == folder | Display title |
| `structural_now` | Sum of point rules | Independent score |
| `notes` | v1 miss / non-KEEP still in tree | |

## Coverage

**454 / 33** — 454 folders matched a July CSV `skill` row; **33** v1 chairs have no independent row (no invented `my_score`). Two July-hit twins were cut this leftover wave (`godot-gdscript-patterns`, `illustration-direction`).

Hit independent scores: min **57.8** / mean **91.1** / max **97.8** (public set is the KEEP-heavy slice; the 2,540-row private mean was **69.2**).

**Misses (independent columns empty):**  
`addvalue`, `better`, `goal`, `godot-2d-animation`, `godot-2d-physics`, `godot-3d-lighting`, `godot-3d-materials`, `godot-3d-world-building`, `godot-animation-player`, `godot-animation-tree-mastery`, `godot-audio-systems`, `godot-autoload-architecture`, `godot-camera-systems`, `godot-characterbody-2d`, `godot-combat-system`, `godot-composition`, `godot-debugging-profiling`, `godot-dialogue-system`, `godot-export-builds`, `godot-gdscript-mastery`, `godot-save-load-systems`, `godot-state-machine-advanced`, `godot-ui`, `grokimagine`, `inspire-quote-effects`, `local-media-router`, `localimage-stills`, `localvideo`, `quality-at-scale`, `review-results`, `threejs-skill-router`, `transition`, `yt-shorts-flow-director`

Spot-check vs July CSV: `git-workflow` 92.2 A QUALITY_KEEP; `chroma` 92.2 A; `glassmorphism` 90.0 A; `stable-diffusion` 95.6 A+; `better` has no independent row.

## Independent non-KEEP still in tree

July `independent_decision` was **not** `QUALITY_KEEP`; still in tree **pending review**. Do not hide them.

| Skill | Decision | Grade | independent_score |
|-------|----------|-------|------------------:|
| `chrome-browser-automation` | LIBRARY_ONLY | C | 63.3 |
| `comfyui-workflow-builder` | LIBRARY_ONLY | B- | 74.4 |
| `context-optimization` | LIBRARY_ONLY | C+ | 66.7 |
| `senior-frontend` | MERGE_OR_DROP | C+ | 67.8 |
| `svg-quality-audit` | DROP | D | 57.8 |

July D on `svg-quality-audit` is **likely stale**: the public folder now ships `scripts/structure_scan.py`, `scripts/render_vision_judge.py`, and `references/`. See [QUALITY_IMPROVE.md](QUALITY_IMPROVE.md). Do not restamp the independent grade from a description-only pass.

This leftover wave **cut** `godot-gdscript-patterns` and `illustration-direction` from git (recommend-cut executed). `chrome-browser-automation`, `comfyui-workflow-builder`, `context-optimization`, `senior-frontend` remain improved in place. Remaining KEEP B+ chairs (`game-godot`, `ollama`, `web-interface-guidelines`) were improved in the prior wave. Details: [QUALITY_IMPROVE.md](QUALITY_IMPROVE.md).
